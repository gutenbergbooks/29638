<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>POTTER&#8217;S CLAY</h3>
</div>
<p>Scipio moved about the room uncertainly. It was
characteristic of him. Nature had given him an expression
that suggested bewilderment, and, somehow, this expression
had got into his movements.</p>
<p>He was swabbing the floor with a rag mop; a voluntary
task, undertaken to relieve his wife, who was lounging over
the glowing cookstove, reading a cheap story book. Once
or twice he paused in his labors, and his mild, questioning
blue eyes sought the woman&#8217;s intent face. His stubby,
work-soiled fingers would rake their way through his straw-colored
hair, which grew sparsely and defiantly, standing
out at every possible unnatural angle, and the mop would
again flap into the muddy water, and continue its process of
smearing the rough boarded floor.</p>
<p>Now and again the sound of children&#8217;s voices floated in
through the open doorway, and at each shrill piping the
man&#8217;s pale eyes lit into a smile of parental tenderness. But
his work went on steadily, for such was the deliberateness
of his purpose.</p>
<p>The room was small, and already three-quarters of it had
been satisfactorily smeared, and the dirt spread to the necessary
consistency. Now he was nearing the cookstove
where the woman sat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d hate to worry you any, Jess,&#8221; he said, in a gentle,
apologetic voice, &#8220;but I&#8217;m right up to this patch. If you&#8217;d
kind of lift your feet, an&#8217; tuck your skirts around you some,
guess you could go right on reading your fiction.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman looked up with a peevish frown. Then
something like a pitying smile warmed her expression. She
was a handsome creature, of a large, somewhat bold type,
with a passionate glow of strong youth and health in every
feature of her well-shaped face. She was taller than her
diminutive husband, and, in every detail of expression, his
antithesis. She wore a dress with some pretensions to
display, and suggesting a considerable personal vanity. But
it was of the tawdry order that was unconvincing, and lacked
both refinement and tidiness.</p>
<p>Scipio followed up his words with a glance of smiling
amiability.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m real sorry&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he began again.</p>
<p>But she cut him short.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, bother!&#8221; she exclaimed; and, thrusting her slippered
feet upon the stove, tucked her skirts about her.
Then, utterly ignoring him, she buried herself once more
in her book.</p>
<p>The mop flapped about her chair legs, the water splashed
the stove. Scipio was hurrying, and consequently floundering.
It was his endeavor not to disturb his wife more than
was necessary.</p>
<p>Finally he wrung out his mop and stood it outside the
door in the sun. He emptied his bucket upon the few
an&aelig;mic cabbages which grew in an untidy patch at the side
of the hut, and returned once more to the room.</p>
<p>He glanced round it with feeble appreciation. It was a
hopeless sort of place, yet he could not detect its shortcomings.
The rough, log-built walls, smeared with a mud
plaster, were quite unadorned. There was one solitary
opening for a window, and in the center of the room was a
roughly manufactured table, laden with the remains of
several repasts. Breakfast was the latest, and the smell of
coffee and fried pork still hung about the room. There were
two Windsor chairs, one of which his wife was occupying,
and a ramshackle food cupboard. Then there were the
cookstove and a fuel box, and two or three iron pots hanging
about the walls.</p>
<p>Out of this opened a bedroom, and the rough bedstead,
with its tumbled blankets, was in full view where Scipio
stood. Although the morning was well advanced the bed
was still unmade. Poor as the place was, it might, in the
hands of a busy housewife, have presented a very different
appearance. But Jessie was not a good housewife. She
hated the care of her little home. She was not a bad woman,
but she had no sympathy with the harshnesses of life.
She yearned for the amplitude to which she had been
brought up, and detested bitterly the pass to which her husband&#8217;s
incapacity had brought her.</p>
<p>When she had married Scipio he had money&ndash;&ndash;money
that had been left to him for the purpose of embarking in
business, a purpose he had faithfully carried out. But his
knowledge of business was limited to the signing of checks
in favor of anyone who wanted one, and, as a consequence,
by the time their twins were three years old he had received
an intimation from the bank that he must forthwith put
them in credit for the last check he had drawn.</p>
<p>Thus it was that, six months later, the thirty or forty
inhabitants of Job&#8217;s Flat on Suffering Creek&ndash;&ndash;a little mining
camp stowed away in the southwest corner of Montana,
almost hidden amongst the broken foothills of the
Rocky Mountains&ndash;&ndash;basking in the sunshine of a Sunday
afternoon haze, were suddenly startled by the apparition of
a small wagon, driven by a smaller man with yellow hair,
bearing down upon them. But that which stirred them most
surely was the additional sight of a handsome girl, sitting
at his side, and, crowded between them on the seat, a pair of
small children.</p>
<p>Scipio, in a desperate effort to restore his fortunes, and
set his precious family once more on a sound financial basis,
had come in search of the gold which report said was to be
had on Suffering Creek for the trouble of picking it up.</p>
<p>This vision startled Suffering Creek, which, metaphorically,
sat up and rubbed its eyes. Here was something quite
unaccustomed. The yellow-haired fragment of humanity at
the end of the reins was like nothing they had ever seen;
the children were a source of wondering astonishment; but
the woman&ndash;&ndash;ah! There was one woman, and one woman
only, on Suffering Creek until Jessie&#8217;s arrival, and she was
only the &#8220;hash-slinger&#8221; at Minky&#8217;s store.</p>
<p>The newcomer&#8217;s face pleased them. Her eyes were fine,
and full of coquetry. Her figure was all that a woman&#8217;s
should be. Yes, the camp liked the look of her, and so it
set out to give Scipio a hearty welcome.</p>
<p>Now a mining camp can be very cordial in its rough way.
It can be otherwise, too. But in this case we have only to
do with its cordiality. The men of Suffering Creek were
drawn from all sorts and conditions of society. The majority
of them lived like various grades of princes when
money was plentiful, and starved when Fortune frowned.
There were men amongst them who had never felt the softer
side of life, and men who had been ruthlessly kicked from
that downy couch. There were good men and scoundrels,
workers and loafers; there were men who had few scruples,
and certainly no morals whatever. But they had met on a
common ground with the common purpose of spinning fortune&#8217;s
wheel, and the sight of a woman&#8217;s handsome face set
them tumbling over each other to extend the hand of friendship
to her husband.</p>
<p>And the simple-minded Scipio quickly fell into the fold.
Nor was it long before his innocence, his mildness, his never-failing
good-nature got hold of this cluster of ruffians.
They laughed at him&ndash;&ndash;he was a source of endless amusement
to them&ndash;&ndash;but they liked him. And in such men liking
meant a great deal.</p>
<p>But from the first Scipio&#8217;s peculiar nature, and it was
peculiar, led him into many grievous mistakes. His mind
was full of active purpose. He had an enormous sense of
responsibility and duty to those who belonged to him. But
somehow he seemed to lack any due sense of proportion in
those things which were vital to their best interests. Ponderous
thought had the effect of turning his ideas upside
down, leaving him with but one clear inspiration. He must
do. He must act&ndash;&ndash;and at once.</p>
<p>Thus it was he gave much consideration to the selection
of the site of his house. He wanted a southern aspect, it
must be high up, it must not be crowded amongst the other
houses. The twins needed air. Then the nearer he was to
the creek, where the gold was to be found, the better. And
again his prospecting must tap a part of it where the diggers
had not yet &#8220;claimed.&#8221; There were a dozen and one things
to be considered, and he thought of them all until his gentle
mind became confused and his sense of proportion completely
submerged.</p>
<p>The result was, he settled desperately upon the one site
that common sense should have made him avoid. Nor was
it until the foundations of the house had been laid, and the
walls were already half their full height, that he realized,
from the desolation of refuse and garbage strewn everywhere
about him, that his home was overlooking the camp
&#8220;dumps.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, it was too late to make any change, and, with
characteristic persistence, he completed his work and went
into residence with his wife and the twins.</p>
<p>The pressure of work lessened, he had a moment in
which to look around. And with the thought of his twins
on his mind, and all his wife had once been accustomed to,
he quickly realized the necessity of green vegetables in his
<i>m&eacute;nage</i>. So he promptly flew to the task of arranging a
cabbage patch. The result was a foregone conclusion. He
dug and planted his patch. Nor was it until the work was
completed that it filtered through to his comprehension that
he had selected the only patch in the neighborhood with a
heavy underlay of gravel and lime stone.</p>
<p>But his crowning effort was his search for gold. There
are well-established geological laws governing the prospector&#8217;s
craft which no experienced gold-seeker ever departs
from. These were all carefully explained to him by willing
tongues. Then, after poring over all he had learned, and
thought and searched for two days and two nights, he finally
discovered a spot where no other prospector had staked the
ground.</p>
<p>It was a curious, gloomy sort of patch, nearly half-a-mile
up the creek from the camp, and further in towards the
mountains. Just at this spot the banks of the creek were
high, there was an unusual blackness about the soil, and it
gave out a faint but unrecognizable odor, that, in the bright
mountain air, was quite pleasant. For several hundred
yards the ground of this flat was rankly spongy, with an
oozy surface. Then, beyond, lay a black greasy-looking
marsh, and further on again the hills rose abruptly with the
facets of auriferous-looking soil, such as the prospector loves
to contemplate.</p>
<p>Scipio pondered. And though the conditions outraged all
he had been told of the craft he was embarking upon, he
plunged his pick into this flat, and set to work with characteristic
good-will.</p>
<p>The men of the camp when they discovered his venture
shook their heads and laughed. Then their laugh died out
and their hard eyes grew serious. But no one interfered.
They were all seeking gold.</p>
<p>This was Scipio&#8217;s position on Suffering Creek, but it does
not tell half of what lay somewhere in the back of his
quaintly-poised mind. No one who knew him failed to
realize his worship for his wife. His was a love such as
rarely falls to the lot of woman. And his devotion to his
girl and boy twins was something quite beyond words.
These things were the mainspring of his life, and drove
him to such superlative degrees of self-sacrifice that could
surely only have been endured by a man of his peculiar
mind.</p>
<p>No matter what the toil of his claim, he always seemed
to find leisure and delight in saving his wife from the
domestic cares of their home. And though weary to the
breaking-point with his toil, and consumed by a hunger
that was well-nigh painful, when food was short he never
seemed to realize his needs until Jessie and the children had
eaten heartily. And afterwards no power on earth could
rob him of an hour&#8217;s romp with the little tyrants who ruled
and worshiped him.</p>
<p>Now, as he stood before the littered table, he glanced out
at the sun. The morning was advancing all too rapidly.
His eyes drifted across to his wife. She was still reading.
A light sigh escaped him. He felt he should be out on his
claim. However, without further thought he took the boiler
of hot water off the stove and began to wash up.</p>
<p>It was the clatter of the plates that made Jessie look
up.</p>
<p>&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake!&#8221; she exclaimed, with exasperation.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll be bathing the children next. Say, you can just
leave those things alone. I&#8217;ve only got a bit more to read
to the end of the chapter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought maybe it &#8217;ud help you out some. I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You give me a pain, you sure do,&#8221; Jessie broke in.
&#8220;You get right out and hustle gold, and leave things of that
sort to others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t mind doing it, truth I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Scipio expostulated
mildly. &#8220;I just thought it would save you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessie gave an artificial sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;You tire me. Do you think I don&#8217;t know my work?
I&#8217;m here to do the chores&ndash;&ndash;and well I know it. You&#8217;re
here to do a man&#8217;s work, same as any other man. You get
out and find the gold, I can look after the house&ndash;&ndash;if you
can call it a house,&#8221; she added contemptuously.</p>
<p>Her eyes were quite hopeless as she let them wander
over the frowsiness in the midst of which she sat. She was
particularly discontented this morning. Not only had her
thoughts been rudely dragged back from the seductive contemplation
of the doings of the wealthy ones as the dime
fiction-writer sees them, but there was a feeling of something
more personal. It was something which she hugged
to her bosom as a priceless pearl of enjoyment in the midst
of a barren, rock-bound life of squalor.</p>
<p>The sight of him meandering about the room recalled
these things. Thoughts, while they troubled her, yet had
power to stimulate and excite her; thoughts which she
almost dreaded, but which caused her exquisite delight.
She must get rid of him.</p>
<p>But as she looked about the room something very like
dismay assailed her. There were the hated household duties
confronting her; duties she was longing to be free of,
duties which she was tempted to abandon altogether, with
everything else that concerned her present sordid life.</p>
<p>But Scipio knew none of this. His unsuspicious nature
left him utterly blinded to the inner workings of her indolent,
selfish spirit, and was always ready to accept blame for
her ill-humors. Now he hurriedly endeavored to make
amends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you can, Jess,&#8221; he said eagerly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
guess there&#8217;s another woman around who can manage things
like you. You don&#8217;t never grumble at things, and goodness
knows I couldn&#8217;t blame you any, if you did. But&ndash;&ndash;but
ther&#8217; seems such a heap to be done&ndash;&ndash;for you to do,&#8221; he went
on, glancing with mild vengefulness at the litter. &#8220;Say,&#8221;
he cried, with a sudden lightening and inspiration, &#8220;maybe
I could buck some wood for you before I go. You&#8217;ll need
a good fire to dry the kiddies by after you washened &#8217;em.
It sure wouldn&#8217;t kep me long.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the only effect of his persistent kindliness was to
further exasperate his wife. Every word, every gentle intention
on his part made her realize her own shortcomings
more fully. In her innermost heart she knew that she had
no desire to do the work; she hated it, she was lazy. She
knew that he was far better than she; good, even noble,
in spite of his mental powers being so lamentably at fault.
All this she knew, and it weakly maddened her because
she could not rise above herself and show him all the woman
that was so deeply hidden under her cloak of selfishness.</p>
<p>Then there was that other thought, that something that
was her secret. She had that instinct of good that made it
a guilty secret. Yet she knew that, as the world sees
things, she had as yet done no great harm.</p>
<p>And therein lay the mischief. Had she been a vicious
woman nothing would have troubled her, but she was not
vicious. She was not even less than good in her moral
instincts. Only she was weak, hopelessly weak, and so
all these things drove her to a shrewish discontent and
peevishness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s no peace where you are,&#8221; she cried, passionately
flinging her book aside and springing to her feet.
&#8220;Do you think I can&#8217;t look to this miserable home you&#8217;ve
given me? I hate it. Yes, I hate it all. Why I married
you I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know. Look at it. Look round you,
and if you have any idea of things at all what can you see
but a miserable hog pen? Yes, that&#8217;s it, a hog pen. And
we are the hogs. You and me, and&ndash;&ndash;and the little ones.
Why haven&#8217;t you got some &#8216;get up&#8217; about you? Why
don&#8217;t you earn some money, get some somehow so we can
live as we&#8217;ve been used to living? Why don&#8217;t you do something,
instead of pottering around here trying to do chores
that aren&#8217;t your work, an&#8217; you can&#8217;t do right anyway? You
make me mad&ndash;&ndash;you do indeed. But there! There&#8217;s no
use talking to you, none whatever!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Jess. I&#8217;m real sorry you feel like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio left the table and moved to the cupboard, into which
he mechanically began to stow the provender. It was an
unconscious action and almost pathetic in its display of that
kindly purpose, which, where his wife was concerned, was
never-failing. Jessie saw, angry as she was, and her fine
eyes softened. Perhaps it was the maternal instinct underlying
the selfishness that made her feel something akin to a
pitying affection for her little husband.</p>
<p>She glanced down at the boiler of water, and mechanically
gathered some of the tin plates together and proceeded to
wash them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m kind of sorry, Zip,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I just didn&#8217;t mean
all that. Only&ndash;&ndash;only it makes me feel bad seeing all this
around, and you&ndash;&ndash;you always trying to do both a man&#8217;s and
a woman&#8217;s work. Things are bad with us, so bad they seem
hopeless. We&#8217;re right here with two kiddies and&ndash;&ndash;and
ourselves, and there&#8217;s practically no money and no prospects
of there being any. It makes me want to cry. It makes
me want to do something desperate. It makes me hate
things&ndash;&ndash;even those things I&#8217;ve no right to hate. No, no,&#8221;
as the man tried to stop her, &#8220;don&#8217;t you say anything. Not
a word till I&#8217;ve done. You see, I mayn&#8217;t feel like talking of
these things again. Maybe I shan&#8217;t never have a chance of
talking them again.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sighed and stared out of window.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to understand things as I see them, and
maybe you&#8217;ll not blame me if I see them wrong. You&#8217;re
too good for me, and I&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t seem grateful for your
goodness. You work and think of others as no other man
would do. You don&#8217;t know what it is to think of yourself.
It&#8217;s me, and the children first with you, and, Zip&ndash;&ndash;and
you&#8217;ve no call to think much of me. Yes, I know what
you&#8217;d say. I&#8217;m the most perfect woman on earth. I&#8217;m not.
I&#8217;m not even good. If I were I&#8217;d be glad of all you try to
do; I&#8217;d help you. But I don&#8217;t, and&ndash;&ndash;and I just don&#8217;t seem
able to. I&#8217;m always sort of longing and longing for the
old days. I long for those things we can never have. I
think&ndash;&ndash;think always of folks with money, their automobiles,
their grand houses, with lots and lots of good things to
eat. And it makes me hate&ndash;&ndash;all&ndash;&ndash;all this. Oh, Zip, I&#8217;m
sorry. I&#8217;m sorry I&#8217;m not good. But I&#8217;m not, and I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She broke off and dashed the back of her hand across her
eyes in time to wipe away the great tears that threatened to
roll down her rounded cheeks. In a moment Scipio was
at her side, and one arm was thrust about her waist, and he
seized one of her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t to cry,&#8221; he said tenderly, as though she
were a child. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t, Jess&ndash;&ndash;truth. You ain&#8217;t what
you&#8217;re saying. You ain&#8217;t nothing like it. You&#8217;re dear and
good, and it&#8217;s &#8217;cause you&#8217;re that good and honest you&#8217;re
saying all these things. Do you think I don&#8217;t know just
how you&#8217;re suffering? Do you? Why, Jess, I know just
everything about you, and it nigh breaks my heart to think
of all I&#8217;ve brought you to. It ain&#8217;t you, Jess, it&#8217;s me who&#8217;s
bad. It&#8217;s me who&#8217;s a fool. I hain&#8217;t no more sense than a
buck rabbit, and I ain&#8217;t sure a new-littered pup couldn&#8217;t
put me to sleep for savvee. Now don&#8217;t you go to crying.
Don&#8217;t you indeed. I just can&#8217;t bear to see those beautiful
eyes o&#8217; yours all red and running tears. And, say, we sure
have got better prospects than you&#8217;re figgering. You see,
I&#8217;ve got a claim there&#8217;s no one else working on. And sure
there&#8217;s minerals on it. Copper&ndash;&ndash;or leastways it looks like
copper, and there&#8217;s mica, an&#8217; lots&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; lots of stuff. I&#8217;ll
sure find gold in that claim. It&#8217;s just a matter of keepin&#8217;
on. And I&#8217;m going to. And then, when we find it, what
a blow-out we&#8217;ll have. We&#8217;ll get automobiles and houses,
and&ndash;&ndash;and we&#8217;ll have a bunch of sweet corn for supper,
same as we had at a hotel once, and then&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But the woman had suddenly drawn away from his
embrace. She could stand no more of her little husband&#8217;s
pathetic hopes. She knew. She knew, with the rest of the
camp, the hopelessness of his quest, and even in her worst
moments she had not the heart to destroy his illusions. It
was no good, the hopelessness of it all came more than ever
upon her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zip dear,&#8221; she said, with a sudden, unwonted tenderness
that had something strangely nervous in it, &#8220;don&#8217;t you
get staying around here or I&#8217;ll keep right on crying. You
get out to your work. I&#8217;m feeling better now, and you&#8217;ve&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ve
made things look kind of brighter,&#8221; she lied.</p>
<p>She glanced out of window, and the height of the sun
seemed suddenly to startle her. Her more gentle look suddenly
vanished and one of irritability swiftly replaced it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, won&#8217;t you let me help you with all these things?&#8221;
Scipio coaxed.</p>
<p>But Jessie had seemingly quite forgotten her moment of
tenderness.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said sharply. &#8220;You get right out to work.&#8221;
Then after a pause, with a sudden warming in her tone,
&#8220;Think of Jamie and Vada. Think of them, and not of
me. Their little lives are just beginning. They are quite
helpless. You must work for them, and work as you&#8217;ve
never done before. They are ours, and we love them. I
love them. Yes&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;with a harsh laugh&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;better than myself.
Don&#8217;t you think of me, Zip. Think of them, and
work for them. Now be off. I don&#8217;t want you here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio reluctantly enough accepted his dismissal. His
wife&#8217;s sudden nervousness of manner was not hidden from
him. He believed that she was seriously upset, and it pained
and alarmed his gentle heart. But the cause of her condition
did not enter into his calculations. How should it?
The reason of things seemed to be something which his mind
could neither grasp nor even inquire into. She was troubled,
and he&ndash;&ndash;well, it made him unhappy. She said go and
work, work for the children. Ah, yes, her thoughts were
for the children, womanly, unselfish thoughts just such as a
good mother should have. So he went, full of a fresh enthusiasm
for his work and for his object.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Jessie went on with her work. And strangely
enough her nervousness increased as the moments went by,
and a vague feeling of apprehension took hold of her. She
hurried desperately. To get the table cleared was her chief
concern. How she hated it. The water grew cold and
greasy, and every time she dipped her cloth into it she shuddered.
Again and again her eyes turned upon the window
surveying the bright sunlight outside. The children playing
somewhere beyond the door were ignored. She was even
trying to forget them. She heard their voices, and they set
her nerves jangling with each fresh peal of laughter, or
shrill piping cry.</p>
<p>At last the last plate and enameled cup was washed and
dried. The boiler was emptied and hung upon the wall.
She swabbed the table carelessly and left it to dry. Then,
with a rush, she vanished into the inner room.</p>
<p>The moments passed rapidly. There was no sound beyond
the merry games of the twins squatting out in the sun,
digging up the dusty soil with their fat little fingers. Jessie
did not reappear.</p>
<p>At last a light, decided step sounded on the creek side of
the house. It drew nearer. A moment or two later a
shadow flitted across the window. Then suddenly a man&#8217;s
head and shoulders filled up the opening. The head bent
forward, craning into the room, and a pair of handsome
eyes peered curiously round.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi!&#8221; he cried in a suppressed tone. &#8220;Hi! Jessie!&#8221;</p>
<p>The bedroom curtain was flung aside, and Jessie, arrayed
carefully in her best shirtwaist and skirt, suddenly appeared
in the doorway. Her eyes were glowing with excitement
and fear. But her rich coloring was alight with warmth,
and the man stared in admiration. Yes, she was very good
to look upon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE HARVEST OF PASSION</h3>
</div>
<p>For one passionate moment the woman&#8217;s radiant face held
the gaze of the man. He was swayed with an unwholesome
hunger at the sight of her splendid womanhood. The
beautiful, terrified eyes, so full of that allurement which
ever claims all that is vital in man; the warm coloring of her
delicately rounded cheeks, so soft, so downy; the perfect
undulations of her strong young figure&ndash;&ndash;these things
caught him anew, and again set raging the fire of a reckless,
vicious passion. In a flash he had mounted to the sill of the
window-opening, and dropped inside the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say&ndash;&ndash;Jessie,&#8221; he breathed hotly. &#8220;You&#8217;re&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re
fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>His words were almost involuntary. It was as though
they were a mere verbal expression of what was passing
through his mind, and made without thought of addressing
her. He was almost powerless in his self-control before her
beauty. And Jessie&#8217;s conscience in its weakly life could not
hold out before the ardor of his assault. Her eyelids lowered.
She stood waiting, and in a moment the bold invader
held her crushed in his arms.</p>
<p>She lay passive, yielding to his caresses for some moments.
Then of a sudden she stirred restlessly. She struggled
weakly to free herself. Then, as his torrential kisses
continued, sweeping her lips, her eyes, her cheeks, her hair,
something like fear took hold of her. Her struggles suddenly
became real, and at last she stood back panting, but
with her young heart mutely stirred to a passionate response.</p>
<p>Nor was it difficult, as they stood thus, to understand how
nature rose dominant over all that belonged to the higher
spiritual side of the woman. The wonderful virility in her
demanded life in the full flood of its tide, and here, standing
before her, was the embodiment of all her natural, if baser,
ideals.</p>
<p>The man was a handsome, picturesque creature bred on
lines of the purer strains. He had little enough about him
of the rough camp in which she lived. He brought with
him an atmosphere of cities, an atmosphere she yearned for.
It was in his dress, in his speech, in the bold daring of his
handsome eyes. She saw in his face the high breeding of
an ancient lineage. There was such a refinement in the
delicate chiseling of his well-molded features. His brows
were widely expressive of a strong intellect. His nose possessed
that wonderful aquilinity associated with the highest
type of Indian. His cheeks were smooth, and of a delicacy
which threw into relief the perfect model of the frame beneath
them. His clean-shaven mouth and chin suggested all
that which a woman most desires to behold in a man. His
figure was tall and muscular, straight-limbed and spare;
while in his glowing eyes shone an irresistible courage, a fire
of passion, and such a purpose as few women could
withstand. And so the wife of Scipio admitted her defeat
and yielded the play of all her puny arts, that she might
appear sightly in his eyes.</p>
<p>But she only saw him as he wished her to see him. He
showed her the outward man. The inner man was something
not yet for her to probe. He was one of Nature&#8217;s
anachronisms. She had covered a spirit which was of the
hideous stock from which he sprang with a gilding of
superlative manhood.</p>
<p>His name was James, a name which, in years long past,
the Western world of America had learned to hate with a
bitterness rarely equaled. But all that was almost forgotten,
and this man, by reason of his manner, which was
genial, open-handed, even somewhat magnificent, rarely
failed, at first, to obtain the good-will of those with whom
he came into contact.</p>
<p>It was nearly nine months since he first appeared on
Suffering Creek. Apparently he had just drifted there in
much the same way that most of the miners had drifted,
possibly drawn thither out of curiosity at the reports of the
gold strike. So unobtrusive had been his coming that even
in that small community he at first passed almost unobserved.
Yet he was full of interest in the place, and contrived
to learn much of its affairs and prospects. Having
acquired all the information he desired, he suddenly set out
to make himself popular. And his popularity was brought
about by a free-handed dispensation of a liberal supply of
money. Furthermore, he became a prominent devotee at
the poker table in Minky&#8217;s store, and, by reason of the fact
that he usually lost, as most men did who joined in a game
in which Wild Bill was taking a hand, his popularity increased
rapidly, and the simple-minded diggers dubbed him
with the dazzling sobriquet of &#8220;Lord James.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was during this time that he made the acquaintance of
Jessie and her husband, and it was astonishing how swiftly
his friendship for the unsuspicious little man ripened.</p>
<p>This first visit lasted just three weeks. Then, without
warning, and in the same unobtrusive way as he had come,
he vanished from the scene. For the moment Suffering
Creek wondered; then, as is the way of such places, it ceased
to wonder. It was too busy with its own affairs to concern
itself to any great extent with the flotsam that drifted its
way. Scipio wondered a little more than the rest, but his
twins and his labors occupied him so closely that he, too,
dismissed the matter from his mind. As for Jessie, she said
not a word, and gave no sign except that her discontent
with her lot became more pronounced.</p>
<p>But Suffering Creek was not done with James yet. The
next time he came was nearly a month later, just as the
monthly gold stage was preparing for the road, carrying
with it a shipment of gold-dust bound for Spawn City, the
nearest banking town, eighty miles distant.</p>
<p>He at once took up his old position in the place, stayed
two weeks, staked out a claim for himself, and pursued his
intimacy with Scipio and his wife with redoubled ardor.</p>
<p>Before those two weeks were over somehow his popularity
began to wane. This intimacy with Scipio began to
carry an ill-flavor with the men of the place. Somehow it
did not ring pleasantly. Besides, he showed a fresh side to
his character. He drank heavily, and when under the influence
of spirits abandoned his well-polished manners, and
displayed a coarseness, a savage truculence, such as he had
been careful never to show before. Then, too, his claim remained
unworked.</p>
<p>The change in public opinion was subtle, and no one
spoke of it. But there was no regret when, finally, he
vanished again from their midst in the same quiet manner
in which he had gone before.</p>
<p>Then came the catastrophe. Two weeks later a gold
stage set out on its monthly journey. Sixty miles out it
was held up and plundered. Its two guards were shot dead,
and the driver mortally wounded. But fortunately the
latter lived long enough to tell his story. He had been attacked
by a gang of eight well-armed horsemen. They
were all masked, and got clear away with nearly thirty
thousand dollars&#8217; worth of gold.</p>
<p>In the first rush of despairing rage Suffering Creek was
unable to even surmise at the identity of the authors of the
outrage. Then Wild Bill, the gambler, demanded an accounting
for every man of the camp on the day of the
tragedy. In a very short time this was done, and the process
turned attention upon Lord James. Where was he?
The question remained unanswered. Suspicions grew into
swift conviction. Men asked each other who he was, and
whence he came. There was no answer to any of their inquiries
at first. Then, suddenly, news came to hand that
the gang, no longer troubling at concealment, was riding
roughshod over the country. It was a return to the r&eacute;gime
of the &#8220;bad man,&#8221; and stock-raiding and &#8220;hold-ups,&#8221; of
greater or less degree, were being carried on in many directions
with absolute impunity; and the man James was at the
head of it.</p>
<p>It was a rude awakening. All the old peace and security
were gone. The camp was in a state of ferment. Every
stranger that came to the place was eyed askance, and unless
he could give a satisfactory account of himself he had a
poor chance with the furious citizens. The future dispatch
of gold became a problem that exercised every mind, and
for two months none left the place. And this fact
brought about a further anxiety. The gang of robbers was
a large one. Was it possible they might attempt a raid
on the place? And, if so, what were their chances of
success?</p>
<p>Such was the position at Suffering Creek, and the nature
of the threat which hung over it. One man&#8217;s name was in
everybody&#8217;s mind. His personality and doings concerned
them almost as nearly as their search for the elusive gold
which was as the breath of life to them.</p>
<p>And yet Lord James was in no way deterred from visiting
the neighborhood. He knew well enough the position
he was in. He knew well enough all its possibilities. Yet
he came again and again. His visits were paid in daylight,
carefully calculated, even surreptitiously made. He sought
the place secretly, but he came, careless of all consequences
to himself. His contempt for the men of Suffering Creek
was profound and unaffected. He probably feared no man.</p>
<p>And the reason of his visits was not far to seek. There
was something infinitely more alluring to him at the house
on the dumps than the gold which held the miners&ndash;&ndash;an
inducement which he had neither wish nor intention to resist.
He reveled in the joy and excitement of pursuing this wife
of another man, and had the camp bristled with an army of
fighting men, and had the chances been a thousand to one
against him, with him the call of the blood would just as
surely have been obeyed. This was the man, savage, crude,
of indomitable courage and passionate recklessness.</p>
<p>And Jessie was dazzled, even blinded. She was just a
weak, erring woman, thrilling with strong youthful life, and
his dominating nature played upon her vanity with an ease
that was quite pitiful. She was only too ready to believe
his denials of the accusations against him. She was only too
ready to&ndash;&ndash;love. The humility, devotion, the goodness of
Scipio meant nothing to her. They were barren virtues, too
unexciting and uninteresting to make any appeal. Her passionate
heart demanded something more stimulating. And
the stimulant she found in the savage wooing of his unscrupulous
rival.</p>
<p>Now the man&#8217;s eyes contemplated the girl&#8217;s ripe beauty,
while he struggled for that composure necessary to carry
out all that was in his mind. He checked a further rising
impulse, and his voice sounded almost harsh as he put a
sharp question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Zip?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s eyelids slowly lifted. The warm glow of her
eyes made them limpid and melting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone out to his claim,&#8221; she said in a low voice.</p>
<p>The other nodded appreciatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to the window. Out across the refuse-heaps
the rest of the camp was huddled together, a squalid collection
of huts, uninspiring, unpicturesque. His glance satisfied
him. There was not a living soul in view; not a sound
except the prattle of the children who were still playing
outside the hut. But the latter carried no meaning to him.
In the heat of the moment even their mother was dead to
the appeal of their piping voices.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re coming away now, Jess,&#8221; the man went on,
making a movement towards her.</p>
<p>But the girl drew back. The directness of his challenge
was startling, and roused in her a belated defensiveness.
Going away? It sounded suddenly terrible to her, and
thrilled her with a rush of fear which set her shivering.
And yet she knew that all along this&ndash;&ndash;this was the end
towards which she had been drifting. The rich color faded
from her cheeks and her lips trembled.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she whispered in a terrified tone. For the
moment all that was best in her rose up and threatened to
defeat his end.</p>
<p>But James saw his mistake. For a second a flash of
anger lit his eyes, and hot resentment flew to his lips. But it
found no expression. Instead, the anger died out of his
eyes, and was replaced by a fire of passion such as had always
won its way with this girl. He moved towards her
again with something subtly seductive in his manner, and his
arms closed about her unresisting form in a caress she was
powerless to deny. Passive yet palpitating she lay pressed
in his arms, all her woman&#8217;s softness, all her subtle perfume,
maddening him to a frenzy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you? I love you, Jessie, so that nothing else on
earth counts. I can&#8217;t do without you&ndash;&ndash;I can&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;I can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>His hot lips crushed against hers, which yielded themselves
all too willingly. Presently he raised his head, and
his eyes held hers. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you come, Jess? There&#8217;s
nothing here for you. See, I can give you all you wish for:
money, a fine home, as homes go hereabouts. My ranch is
a dandy place, and,&#8221; with a curious laugh, &#8220;stocked with
some of the best cattle in the country. You&#8217;ll have horses
to ride, and dresses&ndash;&ndash;See! You can have all you want.
What is there here? Nothing. Say, you don&#8217;t even get
enough to eat. Scipio hasn&#8217;t got more backbone in him
than to gather five cents when it&#8217;s raining dollars.&#8221; He
kissed her upturned face again, and the warm responsive
movement of her lips told him how easy his task really was.</p>
<p>But again she pressed him back, so that he held her only
at arms&#8217; length. Her swimming eyes gazed long and ardently
into his.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that, Jim,&#8221; she said earnestly; &#8220;it isn&#8217;t that.
Those things don&#8217;t count. It&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s you. I&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t want
dresses. I don&#8217;t want the money. I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;want you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she started, terrified again.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Jim, why did you come up to this hut?&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you wait for me down in the bush at
the river, as usual? Oh, Jim, if anybody sees you they&#8217;ll
shoot you down like a dog&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dog, eh?&#8221; cried the man, with a ringing laugh. &#8220;Let
&#8217;em try. But don&#8217;t you worry, Jess. No one saw me.
Anyway, I don&#8217;t care a curse if they did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jim!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she nestled closer to him for a moment of passionate
silence, while he kissed her, prolonging the embrace with all
the fire with which he was consumed. And after that she
spoke again. But now it was the mother that would no
longer be denied, even in the midst of her storm of emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&ndash;&ndash;I can&#8217;t leave them&ndash;&ndash;the little ones. I can&#8217;t, I
can&#8217;t!&#8221; she cried piteously. &#8220;Jim, I love you. God knows
how badly I love you, but I&ndash;&ndash;I love them, too. They are
mine. They are part of me, and&ndash;&ndash;and I can&#8217;t do without
them. No&ndash;&ndash;no. I can&#8217;t go&ndash;&ndash;I won&#8217;t go,&#8221; she hurried on,
without conviction. &#8220;I can&#8217;t. I want my babies&ndash;&ndash;my little
boy and girl. You say you love me. I know you love me.
Then take them with us, and&ndash;&ndash;and I&#8217;ll do as you wish.
Oh, I&#8217;m wicked, I know. I&#8217;m wicked, and cruel, and vile
to leave Scipio. And I don&#8217;t want to, but&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;oh, Jim,
say you&#8217;ll take them, too. I can never be happy without
them. You can never understand. You are a man, and so
strong.&#8221; He drew her to him again, and she nestled close
in his arms. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know what it is to hear a child&#8217;s
voice, and know that it is part of you, your life, one little
tiny atom beginning all over again. No, no&ndash;&ndash;I must have
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>She slowly drew herself away, watching his handsome
face, half fearfully, half eagerly. She knew in her heart
that she was waiting for his verdict, and, whatever it might
be, she would have to abide by it. She knew she must do
as he wished, and that very knowledge gladdened her, even
in spite of her maternal dread of being parted from her
babies.</p>
<p>She saw his expression change. She saw the look of
perplexity in the sudden drawing together of his finely
marked brows, she saw the half-angry impatience flash into
his eyes, she saw this again replaced with a half-derisive
smile. And each emotion she read in her own way, molding
it to suit and fall in with her own desires, yet with a
willing feeling that his decision should be paramount, that
she was there to obey him.</p>
<p>He slowly shook his head, and a curious hardness set
itself about his strong mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I would, but it can&#8217;t be done.
See here, Jess, I&#8217;ve got two horses hidden away down there
in the bush beside the creek&ndash;&ndash;one for you, and one for me.
We can&#8217;t fetch those kiddies along with us now. It wouldn&#8217;t
be safe, anyhow. We&#8217;ve got sixty-odd miles to ride
through the foothills. But see, I&#8217;ll fetch &#8217;em one day, after,
if you must have &#8217;em. How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;ll never let you,&#8221; cried Jessie. &#8220;The whole
camp will be up in arms when they know I&#8217;ve gone. You
don&#8217;t know them, Jim. They&#8217;re fond of Zip, and they&#8217;ll
stand by him.&#8221;</p>
<p>James laughed contemptuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Jess,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;you come right along with me
now. And if you need those kiddies, not all Suffering Creek&ndash;&ndash;no,
nor hell itself&ndash;&ndash;shall stop me bringing &#8217;em along to
you.&#8221; Then he chuckled in an unpleasant manner. &#8220;Say,
it would tickle me to death to set these mutton-headed
gophers jumping around. You&#8217;ll get those kiddies if you
need &#8217;em, if I have to blow hell into this mud-heap of a
city.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessie&#8217;s eyes glowed at the man&#8217;s note of savage strength
and confidence. She knew he could and would do as he
said, and this very fact yielded her to him more surely than
any other display could have done. It was this wonderful
daring, this reckless, savage manhood that had originally
won her. He was so different from all others, from her
puny husband. He swept her along and dazzled her. Her
own virility cried out for such a mate, and no moral scruples
could hope to stay so strong a tide of nature.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do it?&#8221; she cried fervently. Then she nodded
joyously. &#8220;Yes, yes, you&#8217;ll do it. I know it. Oh, how
good you are to me. I love you, Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again she was in his arms. Again his kisses fell hot and
fast upon her glowing face. Nature was rushing a strong
flood tide. It was a moment that could have no repetition
in their lives.</p>
<p>They stood thus, locked in each other&#8217;s arms, borne along
by a passion that was beyond their control&ndash;&ndash;lost to all the
world, lost to all those things which should have mattered
to them. It was the fervid outpouring of two natures which
had nothing that was spiritual in them. They demanded
the life of the senses, and so strong was the desire that they
were lost to all else.</p>
<p>Then suddenly in the midst of their dream came the disturbing
patter of small feet and the joyous, innocent laughter
of infantile glee. Two tiny mud-stained figures rushed
at the doorway and fell sprawling into the hut. They were
on their feet again in a moment, laughing and crowing out
their delight. Then, as the man and woman sprang apart,
they stood round-eyed, wondering and gaping.</p>
<p>Jamie and Vada paused only till the grown-up eyes were
turned in their direction, then their chorus broke out in one
breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got fi&#8217; &#8217;piders&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; two bugs!&#8221;</p>
<p>The important information was fairly shrieked, to the
accompaniment of dancing eyes and flushed cheeks.</p>
<p>Jessie gasped. But her emotion was not at the news so
rudely broken. It was the breaking of the spell which had
held her. Just for one horrific moment she stood staring
helplessly at the innocent picture of her four-year-old twins,
beautiful in spite of their grimy exterior, beautiful as a
Heaven-inspired picture to the mother.</p>
<p>The man smiled. Nor was it an unpleasant smile. Perhaps,
somewhere in his savage composition, he had a
grain of humor; perhaps it was only the foolish smile of
a man whose wits are not equal to so incongruous a situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re most ev&#8217;ry color,&#8221; piped Vada, with added
excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh!&#8221; grunted Jamie in agreement. &#8220;An&#8217; the bugs has
horns.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the man had recovered himself. The interruption
had brought with it a realization of the time he had spent in
the hut.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d best go and find more,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s heaps
outside.&#8221; Then he turned to Jessie. &#8220;Come on. We
must be going. Have you got the things you need ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>But the mother&#8217;s eyes were on the small intruders.
Something was gripping at her heart, and somehow it felt
like four small and dirty hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wher&#8217; you goin&#8217;?&#8221; demanded Vada, her childish
curiosity roused, and all her beautiful spiders forgotten for
the moment.</p>
<p>Her question remained unanswered, leaving the room in
ominous silence. Then Jamie&#8217;s treble blundered into its
midst, dutifully echoing his sister&#8217;s inquiry.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Es, wher&#8217; you doin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s eyes were narrowly watching the woman&#8217;s
face. He noted the tremulous lips, the yearning light in her
eyes. In a moment he was answering the children, lest their
innocent words should upset his plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, your momma&#8217;s going for a horse-ride. She&#8217;s just
going right out, and I&#8217;m going to show her a dandy place
where she can fetch you, so you can catch heaps an&#8217; heaps
of bugs and spiders. She&#8217;s just wanting you to stop right
here and catch more bugs, till I come along and fetch you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O&ndash;&ndash;oh!&#8221; cried Vada, prolonging her exclamation
gleefully. &#8220;Say, can&#8217;t us go now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me do too,&#8221; murmured her faithful shadow.</p>
<p>One quick glance at the mother&#8217;s face and the man spoke
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now, kiddies. I&#8217;ll come and fetch you. Run
along.&#8221; Then he turned swiftly upon Jessie. &#8220;Where&#8217;s
your bundle?&#8221; he asked in his usual masterful manner.</p>
<p>And her reply came in a tone of almost heart-broken
submission.</p>
<p>&#8220;In there,&#8221; she said, with a glance at the inner room.</p>
<p>The man gave her no time to add anything more. He
felt the ground he was treading was more than shaky. He
knew that with the coming of these children a tremendous
power was militating against him&ndash;&ndash;a power which would
need all his wits to combat. He passed into the inner room,
and returned in a moment with the girl&#8217;s bundle. And with
his return one glance showed him how nearly his plans were
upset. Jessie was clasping Jamie in her arms, kissing him
hungrily, tears streaming down her cheeks, while, out of
sheer sympathy, little Vada was clinging to her mother&#8217;s
skirts, her small face buried in amongst them, sobbing as
though her heart would break.</p>
<p>In a moment he was at her side. This was not a time
when any drastic methods could serve him, and he adopted
the only course which his shrewd sense told him would be
likely to avail. Gently but firmly he took the boy out of
her arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want him to go with us?&#8221; he said kindly. &#8220;Very
well. Maybe we&#8217;re doing wrong&ndash;&ndash;I mean, for his sake.
Anyhow, I&#8217;ll carry him, and then I&#8217;ll come back for Vada.
It&#8217;s not good. It&#8217;s too hard on him, carrying him all that
distance&ndash;&ndash;too dangerous. Still, I want you to be happy,
Jess. I&#8217;d do anything for that, even&ndash;&ndash;even at his expense.
So&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;no!&#8221; cried the mother, carried away by the fear
he expressed so subtly, and warmed by his carefully expressed
sympathy. &#8220;Don&#8217;t take any notice of me. I&#8217;m
foolish&ndash;&ndash;silly. You&#8217;re right&ndash;&ndash;he&ndash;&ndash;he couldn&#8217;t make the
journey with us. No, no, we&ndash;&ndash;won&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;take him now.
Set him down, Jim. I&#8217;ll go now, and you&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ll come
back for them. Yes, yes, let&#8217;s go now. I&ndash;&ndash;I can&#8217;t stay
any&ndash;&ndash;longer. I&#8217;ve left a letter for Zip. Swear I shall
have them both. You&#8217;ll never&ndash;&ndash;never break your word?
I think I&#8217;d&ndash;&ndash;die without them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall have them. I swear it.&#8221; The man spoke
readily enough. It was so easy to promise anything, so long
as he got her.</p>
<p>But his oath brought neither expression of gratitude nor
comment. The woman was beyond mere words. She felt
that only flight could save her from breaking down altogether.
And, thus impelled, she tore herself from the
presence of the children and rushed out of the hut. The
horses were down at the creek, and thither she sped, lest her
purpose should fail her.</p>
<p>James followed her. He felt that she must not be left
by herself to think. But at the door he paused and glanced
keenly around him. Then he breathed a sigh of relief.
Not a living soul was to be seen anywhere. It was good;
his plans had worked out perfectly.</p>
<p>He set Jamie down, and, all unconscious of the little
drama being played round his young life, the child stretched
out a chubby hand in the direction of the soap-box he and
his sister had been playing with.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Piders,&#8221; he observed laconically.</p>
<p>Vada rushed past him to inspect their treasures, her tears
already dried into streaks on her dirty little cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; bugs,&#8221; she cried gleefully, squatting beside the box.</p>
<p>They had forgotten.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The man hurried away down towards the creek, bearing
the pitiful bundle of woman&#8217;s raiment. The girl was ahead,
and, as she again came into his view, one thought, and one
thought only, occupied his mind. Jessie was his whole
world&ndash;&ndash;at that moment.</p>
<p>He, too, had forgotten.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve runned away,&#8221; cried Vada, peering into the box.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me don&#8217;t like &#8217;piders,&#8221; murmured Jamie definitely.</p>
<p>Vada&#8217;s great brown eyes filled with tears. Fresh rivulets
began to run down the muddy channels on her downy cheeks.
Her disappointment found vent in great sobbing gulps.</p>
<p>Jamie stared at her in silent speculation. Then one little
fat hand reached out and pushed her. She rolled over and
buried her wet face in the dusty ground and howled heart-brokenly.
Then Jamie crawled close up beside her, and,
stretching himself out, wept his sympathy into the back of
her gaping frock.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE AWAKENING OF SCIPIO</h3>
</div>
<p>At noon the camp began to rouse. The heavy eyes, the
languid stretch, the unmeaning contemplation of the noontide
sunlight, the slow struggles of a somnolent brain.
These things were suggested in the gradual stirring of the
place to a ponderous activity. The heavy movement of
weary diggers as they lounged into camp for their dinner
had no suggestion of the greedy passion which possessed
them. They had no lightness. Whatever the lust for gold
that consumed them, all their methods were characterized
by a dogged endeavor which took from them every particle
of that nervous activity which belongs to the finely tempered
business man.</p>
<p>The camp was a single row of egregious dwellings, squat,
uncouth, stretching away on either side of the veranda-fronted
store and &#8220;gambling hell&#8221; which formed a sort of
center-piece around which revolved the whole life of the
village. It was a poor, mean place, shapeless, evil-smelling
in that pure mountain air. It was a mere shelter, a rough
perch for the human carrion lusting for the orgy of gold
which the time-worn carcass of earth should yield. What
had these people to do with comfort or refinement? What
had they to do with those things calculated to raise the human
mind to a higher spiritual plane? Nothing. All that
might come later, when, their desires satisfied, the weary
body sick and aching, sends fearful thoughts ahead towards
the drab sunset awaiting them. For the moment the full
tide of youth is still running strong. Sickness and death
have no terrors. The fine strength of powerful bodies will
not allow the mind to focus such things.</p>
<p>Out of the rugged hills backing the camp the gold-seekers
struggle to their resting-place. Here, one man comes clambering
over the rough bowlder-strewn path at the base of a
forest-clad hill. Here, an atom of humanity emerges from
the depths of a vast woodland that dwarfs all but the towering
hills. Another toils up a steep hillside from the sluggish
creek. Another slouches along a vague, unmade trail. Yet
another scrambles his way through a low, dense-growing
scrub which lines the sides of a vast ravine, the favored
locality of the gold-seeker.</p>
<p>So they come, one by one, from every direction radiating
about the building, which is Minky&#8217;s store. Their faces
are hard. Their skin is tanned to a leathery hue, and is of
a texture akin to hide. They are silent, thoughtful men,
too. But their silence is of the vast world in which they
delve, and their thought is the thought of men absorbed in
their quest. No, there is no lightness, even in their happiest
moments. To be light, an intelligent swiftness of brain is
needed. And these derelicts have little of such. Although,
when Minky&#8217;s spirit has circulated its poison through
their veins, they are sometimes apt to assume a burlesque
of it.</p>
<p>Now the camp is wide awake. But it is only the wakefulness
of the mother who is roused by the hungry crying
of her infant. It will slumber again when appetites have
been duly appeased.</p>
<p>The milk of human kindness is soured by the intense
summer heat. The men are &#8220;grouchy.&#8221; They jostle
harshly as they push up to Minky&#8217;s counter for the
&#8220;appetizers&#8221; they do not need. Their greetings are few,
and mostly confined to the abrupt demand, &#8220;Any luck?&#8221;
Then, their noon-day drink gulped down, they slouch off
into the long, frowsy dining-room at the back of the store,
and coarsely devour the rough fare provided by the buxom
Birdie Mason, who is at once the kindliest and worst caterer
imaginable.</p>
<p>This good-natured soul&#8217;s position was not as enviable as
one might reasonably have supposed. The only woman in
a camp of men, any one of whom might reasonably strike a
fortune in five minutes. The situation suggests possibilities.
But, alas, Birdie was just a woman, and, in consequence,
from a worldly point of view, her drawbacks were many.
She was attractive&ndash;&ndash;a drawback. She was given to a natural
desire to stand first with all men&ndash;&ndash;another drawback. She
was eminently sentimental&ndash;&ndash;a still greater drawback. But
greatest of all she was a sort of public servant in her position
as caterer, and, as such, of less than no account from
the moment the &#8220;beast&#8221; had been satisfied.</p>
<p>She had her moments, moments when the rising good-nature
of her customers flattered her, when she was fussed
over, and petted, as men are ever ready to treat an attractive
member of the opposite sex. But these things led nowhither,
from a point of view of worldly advantage, and,
being just a woman, warm-hearted, uncalculating and profoundly
illogical, she failed to realize the pitfalls that lay
before her, the end which, all unsuspecting, she was steadily
forging towards.</p>
<p>Scipio, like the rest, came into camp for his dinner. His
way lay along the bank of the creek. It was cooler here,
and, until he neared his home, there were no hills up which
to drag his weary limbs. He had had, as usual, an utterly
unprofitable morning amidst the greasy ooze of his claim.
Yet the glitter of the mica-studded quartz on the hillside,
the bright-green and red-brown shading of the milky-white
stone still dazzled his mental sight. There was no wavering
in his belief. These toilsome days were merely the
necessary probation for the culminating achievement. He
assured himself that gold lay hidden there. And it was only
waiting for the lucky strike of his pick. He would find it.
It was just a matter of keeping on.</p>
<p>In his simple mind he saw wonderful visions of all that
final discovery. He dreamt of the day when he should be
able to install his beautiful Jessie in one of those up-town
palaces in New York; when an army of servants should
anticipate her every desire; when the twins should be
launched upon the finest academies the country possessed,
to gorge their young minds to the full with all that which
the minds of the children of earth&#8217;s most fortunate must be
stored. He saw his Jessie clad in gowns which displayed
and enhanced all those beauties with which his devoted
mind endowed her. She should not only be his queen, but
the queen of a social world, which, to his mind, had no
rival. And the happiness of such dreams was beyond compare.
His labor became the work of a love which
stimulated his puny muscles to a pitch which carried him
beyond the feeling of any weariness. For himself he
wanted nothing. For Jessie and the twins the world was
not great enough as a possession.</p>
<p>And was she not worth it? Were they not worth it?
Look at her, so splendid! How she bore with him and all
his petty, annoying ways! Her disposition was not of this
earth, he told himself. Would any other woman put up
with his ill-humors, his shortcomings? He realized how
very trying he must be to any bright, clever woman. He
was not clever, and he knew it, and it made him pity Jessie
for the lot he had brought her to.</p>
<p>And the twins. Vada was the image of her mother. The
big, round, brown eyes, the soft, childish mouth, the waving
brown hair. And Jamie. He had her eyes, too, and her
nose, and her beautiful coloring. What a mercy of
Providence neither of them resembled him. But, then, how
could they, with such a mother? How it delighted him to
think that he was working for them, for her. A thrill of
delight swept over him, and added a spring to his jaded step.
What mattered anything else in the world. He was to give
them all that which the world counted as good. He, alone.</p>
<p>But it was not yet. For a moment a shadow crossed
his radiant face as he toiled up the hill to his hut. It was
gone in a moment, however. How could it stay there with
his thought gilded with such high hopes? It was not yet,
but it would come&ndash;&ndash;must come. His purpose was invincible.
He must conquer and wrench this wealth which
he demanded from the bosom of the hard old earth. And
then&ndash;&ndash;and then&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, kiddies,&#8221; he cried cheerily, as his head rose above
the hilltop and his hut and the two children, playing outside
it, came into his view.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pop-pa!&#8221; shrieked Vada, dropping a paper full of loose
dirt and stones upon her sprawling brother&#8217;s back, in her
haste to reach her diminutive parent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh!&#8221; grunted Jamie, scrambling to his feet and tottering
heavily in the same direction.</p>
<p>There was a curious difference in the size and growth of
these twins. Probably it utterly escaped the adoring eyes
of their father. He only saw the reflected glory of their
mother in them. Their resemblance to her was all that
really mattered to him, but, as a matter of fact, this resemblance
lay chiefly in Vada. She was like her mother in an
extraordinary degree. She was well-grown, strong, and
quite in advance of her years, in her speech and brightness
of intellect. Little Jamie, while he possessed much of his
mother in his face, in body was under-sized and weakly, and
his mind and speech, backward of development, smacked of
his father. He was absolutely dominated by his sister, and
followed her lead in everything with adoring rapture.</p>
<p>Vada reached her father and scrambled agilely up into his
work-soiled arms. She impulsively hugged his yellow head
to her cheeks with both her arms, so that when Jamie came
up he had to content himself by similarly hugging the little
man&#8217;s left knee, and kissing the mud-stains on his trousers
into liquid patches.</p>
<p>But Scipio was impartial. He sat Vada down and picked
her brother up. Then, taking the former&#8217;s hand in his
horny clasp, bore the boy towards the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;You found any gold?&#8221; inquired Vada, repeating a question
she had so often heard her mother put.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Es any&ndash;&ndash;dold?&#8221; echoed Jamie, from his height above
Scipio&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, kiddies,&#8221; the man replied, with a slight sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Vada. But his answer had little significance
for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your momma?&#8221; inquired Scipio, after a pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Momma do hoss-ridin&#8217;,&#8221; replied Jamie, forestalling his
sister for once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; added Vada. &#8220;She gone ridin&#8217;. An&#8217; they&#8217;ll
come an&#8217; take us wher&#8217; ther&#8217;s heaps an&#8217; heaps o&#8217; &#8217;piders, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;
bugs an&#8217; things. He said so&ndash;&ndash;sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He? Who?&#8221;</p>
<p>They had reached the hut and Scipio set Jamie on the
ground as he put his question.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dark man,&#8221; said Vada readily, but wrinkling her
forehead struggling for the name.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh!&#8221; agreed Jamie. &#8220;Mister Dames.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just for a moment a sharp question lit Scipio&#8217;s pale eyes.
But the little ones had no understanding of it. And the
next moment, as their father passed in through the doorway,
they turned to the sand and stone castle they had been
laboriously and futilely attempting to mold into some shape.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you bring up more stones,&#8221; cried Vada authoritatively.
&#8220;Run along, dear,&#8221; she added patronizingly, as
the boy stood with his small hands on his hips, staring
vacantly after his father.</p>
<p>Scipio gazed stupidly about the living-room. The slop-stained
table was empty. The cookstove fire was out.
And, just for a second, the thought flashed through his mind&ndash;&ndash;had
he returned too early for his dinner? No, he knew
he had not. It was dinner-time all right. His appetite told
him that.</p>
<p>For the moment he had forgotten what the children had
told him. His simple nature was not easily open to suspicion,
therefore, like all people of slow brain, this startling
break in the routine of his daily life simply set him wondering.
He moved round the room, and, without being aware
of his purpose, lifted the curtain of turkey red, which
served as a door to the rough larder, and peered in. Then,
as he let the curtain fall again, something stirred within
him. He turned towards the inner room, and his mild voice
called&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jess.&#8221;</p>
<p>His answer was a hollow echo that somehow jarred his
nerves. But he called again&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again came the echo. Then Vada&#8217;s small face appeared
round the door-casing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mom-ma gone hoss-ridin&#8217;,&#8221; she reminded him.</p>
<p>For an instant Scipio&#8217;s face flushed. Then it paled icily
under its tan. His brain was struggling to grasp something
which seemed to be slowly enveloping him, but which his
honest heart would not let him believe. He stared stupidly
at Vada&#8217;s dirty face. Then, as the child withdrew to her
play, he suddenly crossed the room to the curtained bedroom
doorway. He passed through, and the flimsy covering fell to
behind him.</p>
<p>For a space the music of childish voices was the only
sound to break the stillness. The hum of buzzing insects
seemed to intensify the summer heat. For minutes no
movement came from the bedroom. It was like the dread
silence before a storm.</p>
<p>A strange sound came at last. It was something between
a moan and the pained cry of some mild-spirited animal
stricken to death. It had no human semblance, and yet&ndash;&ndash;it
came from behind the dingy print curtain over the bedroom
doorway.</p>
<p>A moment later the curtain stirred and the ghastly face
of Scipio suddenly appeared. He moved out into the living-room
and almost fell into the Windsor chair which had last
been occupied by his wife. A sheet of notepaper was in his
shaking hand, and his pale eyes were staring vacantly at it.
He was not reading. He had read. And that which he had
read had left him dazed and scarcely comprehending. He
sat thus for many minutes. And not once did he stir a
muscle, or lift his eyes from their fixed contemplation.</p>
<p>A light breeze set the larder curtain fluttering. Scipio
started. He stared round apprehensively. Then, as though
drawn by a magnet, his eyes came back to the letter in his
hand, and once more fixed themselves upon the bold handwriting.
But this time there was intelligence in his gaze.
There was intelligence, fear, despair, horror; every painful
emotion was struggling for uppermost place in mind and
heart. He read again carefully, slowly, as though trying
to discover some loophole from the horror of what was
written there. The note was short&ndash;&ndash;so short&ndash;&ndash;there was
not one spark of hope in it for the man who was reading it,
not one expression of feeling other than selfishness. It was
the death-blow to all his dreams, all his desire.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve gone away. I shall never come back. I can&#8217;t
stand this life here any longer. Don&#8217;t try to find me, for
it&#8217;s no use. Maybe what I&#8217;m doing is wicked, but I&#8217;m
glad I&#8217;m doing it. It&#8217;s not your fault&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s just me. I
haven&#8217;t your courage, I haven&#8217;t any courage at all. I just
can&#8217;t face the life we&#8217;re living. I&#8217;d have gone before when
he first asked me but for my babies, but I just couldn&#8217;t part
with them. Zip, I want to take them with me now, but I
don&#8217;t know what Jim&#8217;s arrangements are going to be. I
must have them. I can&#8217;t live without them. And if they
don&#8217;t go with us now you&#8217;ll let them come to me after,
won&#8217;t you? Oh, Zip, I know I&#8217;m a wicked woman, but I
feel I must go. You won&#8217;t keep them from me? Let me
have them. I love them so bad. I do. I do. Good-by
forever.</p>
<p class='ralign'>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Jessie.</span>&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mechanically Scipio folded the paper again and sat
grasping it tightly in one clenched hand. His eyes were
raised and gazing through the doorway at the golden sunlight
beyond. His lips were parted, and there was a strange
dropping of his lower jaw. The tanning of his russet
face looked like a layer of dirt upon a super-whited skin.
He scarcely seemed to breathe, so still he sat. As yet
his despair was so terrible that his mind and heart were
numbed to a sort of stupefaction, deadening the horror of
his pain.</p>
<p>He sat on for many minutes. Then, at last, his eyes
dropped again to the crushed paper, and a quavering sigh
escaped him. He half rose from his seat, but fell back in it
again. Then a sudden spasm seized him, and flinging himself
round he reached out his slight, tanned arms upon the
dirty table, and, his head dropping upon them, he moaned
out the full force of his despair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want her!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Oh, God, I want her!&#8221;</p>
<p>But now his slight body was no longer still. His back
heaved with mute sobs that had no tears. All his gentle
soul was torn and bleeding. He had not that iron in his
composition with which another man might have crushed
down his feelings and stirred himself to a harsh defense.
He was just a warm, loving creature of no great strength
beyond his capacity for human affection and self-sacrifice.
And for the time at least, his sufferings were beyond his
control.</p>
<p>In the midst of his grief two little faces, and two pairs
of round, wondering eyes appeared in the doorway. Two
small infantile minds worked hard at the sight they beheld.
Vada, whose quickness of perception was so much in advance
of her brother&#8217;s, murmured in his ear&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh, seep,&#8221; nodded the faithful boy.</p>
<p>Then four little bare feet began to creep into the room.
Four big brown eyes shone with gleeful anticipation. Four
chubby arms were outstretched as though claiming the victim
of their childish prank. Vada led, but Jamie was close
behind. They stole in, their small feet making not the
slightest sound as they tiptoed towards the stricken man.
Each, thrilling with excitement, was desperately intent upon
frightening him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boo-h!&#8221; cried Vada, her round eyes sparkling as she
reached Scipio&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bo-oh!&#8221; echoed Jamie a second later, chuckling and
gurgling a delight he had no other means of expressing at
the moment.</p>
<p>Scipio raised his haggard face. His unsmiling eyes, so
pale and unmeaning, stared stupidly at the children. And
suddenly the merry smile died out of the young faces, and
an odd contraction of their brows suggested a dawning sympathy
which came wholly from the heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;se cryin&#8217;, poppa,&#8221; cried Vada impulsively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh,&#8221; nodded the boy.</p>
<p>And thereupon great tears welled up into their sympathetic
eyes, and the twins wept in chorus. And somehow
the tears, which had thus far been denied the man, now
slowly and painfully flooded his eyes. He groped the two
children into his arms, and buried his face in the soft wavy
hair which fell in a tangle about the girl&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>For some moments he sat thus, something of his grief
easing in the flood of almost womanish tears. Until, finally,
it was Jamie who saved the situation. His sobs died out
abruptly, and the boy in him stirred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me want t&#8217; eat,&#8221; he protested, without preamble.</p>
<p>The man looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eat?&#8221; he echoed vaguely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Dinner,&#8221; explained Vada, whose tears were still
flowing, but who never failed as her little brother&#8217;s
interpreter.</p>
<p>There was a moment&#8217;s pause while Scipio stared down at
the two faces lifted so appealingly to his. Then a change
came into his expressionless eyes. A smoldering fire began
to burn, which seemed to deepen their weakly coloring.
His drawn face seemed to gather strength. And somehow
even his straw-colored hair, so scanty, ill-grown and
disheveled, looked less like the stubble it so much resembled.
It was almost as though a latent, unsuspected strength were
rousing within him, lifting him from the slough of despair
by which he was so nearly submerged. It was as though
the presence of his twins had drawn from him an acknowledgment
of his duty, a sense which was so strongly and
incongruously developed in his otherwise uncertain character,
and demanded of him a sacrifice of all personal inclination.
They were her children. Yes, and they were his.
Her children&ndash;&ndash;her children. And she was gone. They
had no one to look to, no one to care for them now, but&ndash;&ndash;him.</p>
<p>He sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, kiddies,&#8221; he said, with a painful assumption
of lightness. &#8220;You&#8217;re needing food sure. Say, I guess we
won&#8217;t wait for your momma. We&#8217;ll just hand her an
elegant surprise. We&#8217;ll get dinner ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie gurgled his joyous approval, but Vada was more
intelligible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;We&#8217;ll give her a surprise.&#8221; Then
she turned to Jamie. &#8220;Surprise is when folks do things
that other folks don&#8217;t guess you&#8217;re going to, dear,&#8221; she
explained, to his utter confusion.</p>
<p>Scipio went to the larder and gathered various scraps of
food, and plates, and anything that seemed to him as being
of any possible use in a meal. He re-kindled the fire in the
cookstove and made some coffee. That he understood.
There was no sign of his despair about him now. Perhaps
he was more than usually silent, but otherwise, for the time
at least, he had buried his trouble sufficiently deeply out of
sight, so that at any rate the inquiring eyes of the happy
children could see nothing of it.</p>
<p>They, too, busied themselves in the preparation. Vada
dictated to her father with never flagging tongue, and Jamie
carried everything he could lift to and fro, regardless of
whether he was bringing or taking away. Vada chid him
in her childishly superior way, but her efforts were quite
lost on his delicious self-importance. Nor could there be
any doubt that, in his infantile mind, he was quite assured
that his services were indispensable.</p>
<p>At last the meal was ready. There was nearly everything
of which the household consisted upon the table or in close
proximity to it. Then, when at last they sat down, and
Scipio glanced over the strange conglomeration, his conscience
was smitten.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me you kiddies need bread and milk,&#8221; he said
ruefully. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t guess there&#8217;s any milk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vada promptly threw herself into the breach.</p>
<p>&#8220;On&#8217;y Jamie has bread an&#8217; milk, pop-pa. Y&#8217;see his new
teeth ain&#8217;t through. Mine is. You best cut his up into
wee bits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, of course,&#8221; agreed Scipio in relief. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get
along down to Minky&#8217;s for milk after,&#8221; he added, while he
obediently proceeded to cut up the boy&#8217;s meat.</p>
<p>It was a strange meal. There was something even tragic
in it. The children were wildly happy in the thought that
they had shared in this wonderful surprise for their mother.
That they had assisted in those things which childhood ever
yearns to share in&ndash;&ndash;the domestic doings of their elders.</p>
<p>The man ate mechanically. His body told him to eat,
and so he ate without knowing or caring what. His distraught
mind was traveling swiftly through the barren paths
of hopelessness and despair, while yet he had to keep his
children in countenance under their fire of childish prattle.
Many times he could have flung aside his mask and given
up, but the babyish laughter held him to an effort such as
he had never before been called upon to make.</p>
<p>When the meal was finished Scipio was about to get
up from his chair, but Vada&#8217;s imperious tongue stayed
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ain&#8217;t said grace,&#8221; she declared complainingly.</p>
<p>And the man promptly dropped back into his seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he agreed helplessly.</p>
<p>At once the girl put her finger-tips together before her
nose and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God for my good dinner, Amen, and may we
help fix up after?&#8221; she rattled off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ess,&#8221; added Jamie, &#8220;tank Dod for my dood dinner,
Amen, me fix up, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>And with this last word both children tumbled almost
headlong from the bench which they were sharing. Nor
had their diminutive parent the heart to deny their request.</p>
<p>The next hour was perhaps one of the hardest in Scipio&#8217;s
life. Nothing could have impressed his hopeless position
upon him more than the enthusiastic assistance so cordially
afforded him. While the children had no understanding of
their father&#8217;s grief, while with every heart-beat they glowed
with a loving desire to be his help, their every act was an
unconscious stab which drove him until he could have cried
aloud in agony.</p>
<p>And it was a period of catastrophe. Little Vada scalded
her hand and had to be petted back to her normal condition
of sunny smiles. Jamie broke one of the few plates, and
his tears had to be banished by assurances that it did not
matter, and that he had done his father a kindness by ridding
him of such an ugly plate. Then Vada stumbled into
the garbage pail and had to be carefully wiped, while Jamie
smeared his sparse hair with rancid dripping and insisted he
was &#8220;Injun,&#8221; vociferously proclaiming his desire to &#8220;talp&#8221;
his sister.</p>
<p>But the crowning disaster came when he attempted to
put his threat into execution. He seized a bunch of her hair
in his two chubby hands and began to drag her round the
room. Her howls drew Scipio&#8217;s attention from his work,
and he turned to find them a struggling heap upon the floor.
He dashed to part them, kicked over a bucket of drinking
water in his well-meant hurry, and, finally, had to rescue
them, both drenched to the skin, from the untimely bath.</p>
<p>There was nothing for it but to strip off all their clothes
and dress them up in their nightgowns, for as yet he had
no knowledge of their wardrobe, and send them out to get
warm in the sun, while he dried their day-clothes at the
cookstove.</p>
<p>It was the climax. The man flung himself into a chair
and buried his face in his hands. The mask had dropped
from him. There was no longer any need for pretense.
Once more the grief and horror of his disaster broke through
his guard and left him helpless. The whole world, his life,
everything was engulfed in an abyss of black despair.</p>
<p>He was dry-eyed and desperate. But now somehow his
feelings contained an emotion that the first shock of his loss
had not brought him. He was no longer a prey to a weak,
unresisting submission, the grief of a tortured gentle heart.
There was another feeling. A feeling of anger and resentment
which slowly grew with each moment, and sent
the hot blood surging furiously to his brain. Nor was this
feeling directed against Jessie. How could it be? He loved
her so that her cruel desertion of him appeared to be a matter
for which he was chiefly to blame. Yes, he understood.
He was not the husband for her. How could it be otherwise?
He had no cleverness. He had always been a
failure. No, his anger was not against Jessie. It was the
other. It was the man who had robbed him of all he cared
for in the world.</p>
<p>His anger grew hotter and hotter. And with this growing
passion there came an absolute revulsion of the motive force
that had always governed him. He wanted to hurt. He
wanted to hurt this man, Lord James. And his simple mind
groped for a means to carry out his desire. He began to
think more quickly and clearly, and the process brought him
a sort of cold calmness. Again his grief was thrust out
of his focus, and all his mental energy was concentrated
upon his desire. And he conjured up a succession of
pictures of the tortures and sufferings he desired for this
villain who had so wronged him.</p>
<p>But the pictures were too feeble and wholly inadequate
to satisfy. So gentle was his nature, that, even stirred as
he was, he could not conceive a fitting punishment for so
great an offense. He felt his own inadequacy, his own
feebleness to cope with the problem before him, and so he
sat brooding impotently.</p>
<p>It was all useless. And as the minutes slipped by his
anger began to die out, merging once more into the all-absorbing
grief that underlay it. He was alone. Alone!
He would never see her again. The thought chilled him to
a sudden nervous dread. No, no, it was not possible. She
would come back. She must come back. Yes, yes. She
was his Jessie. His beautiful Jessie. She belonged to him.
And the children. She loved them. How she loved them.
They were theirs. Yes, she would come back. Maybe she
would come back at supper-time. She would understand by
then. Because she was good, and&ndash;&ndash;and kind, and&ndash;&ndash;No,
no, Fate could never be so cruel as to take her from him.</p>
<p>He rose and paced the floor with nervous, uneven strides.
He plunged his hand into his coat pocket and drew out the
letter again. He re-read it, with hot eyes and straining
thought. Every word seemed to sear itself upon his poor
brain, and drive him to the verge of distraction. Why?
Why? And he raised his bloodshot eyes to the roof of his
hut, and crushed the paper in one desperate hand.</p>
<p>Then suddenly he started. His pale eyes took on a
furtive frightened expression. He glanced fearfully round
the room as though someone was in hiding to surprise his
inspiration. Yes, that was it. Why not? He was not
afraid. He was afraid of no one. Yes, yes, he had the
means. He must make the opportunity. She was his. No
one else had a right to her. It was justifiable. It was no
more than justice.</p>
<p>He moved towards the inner room. He was less furtive
now. His purpose had startled him at first, but now he was
convinced it was right. To a man of his character his
resolve once taken there was only one thing to do&ndash;&ndash;to carry
it out.</p>
<p>He passed into the bedroom, and, in a few moments,
reappeared. Now he was bearing something in his hand.
He held it carefully, and in his eyes was something like
terror of what he held. The thing he carried was an old-fashioned
revolver. It was rusty. But it had a merciless
look about it. He turned it up gingerly. Then he opened
the breach, and loaded all the six chambers. Then he
carefully bestowed it in his coat pocket, where it bulged
obtrusively.</p>
<p>Now he moved to the open doorway, and somehow his
original furtiveness had returned to him. Here he paused
as the voice of the twins reached and held him. They were
still playing in the sun, banking up the sand and stones in
their futile attempt at castle building. He breathed hard,
as though summoning up all his decision. Then he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, kiddies,&#8221; he said firmly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be right back at
supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he moved out without another look in their direction,
and walked off in the direction of Minky&#8217;s store.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>SCIPIO BORROWS A HORSE</h3>
</div>
<p>Scipio found an almost deserted camp after floundering
his way over the intricate paths amongst the refuse-heaps.</p>
<p>The miners had departed to their claims with a punctuality
that suggested Trades Union principles. Such was their
existence. They ate to live; they lived to work, ever tracking
the elusive metal to the earth&#8217;s most secret places. The
camp claimed them only when their day&#8217;s work was done;
for the rest, it supported only their most urgent needs.</p>
<p>Sunny Oak, lounging on a rough bench in the shadiest
part of the veranda facing Minky&#8217;s store, raised a pair of
heavy eyelids, to behold a dejected figure emerge from
amidst the &#8220;dumps.&#8221; The figure was bearing towards the
store in a dusty cloud which his trailing feet raised at every
step. His eyes opened wider, and interested thought stirred
in his somnolent brain. He recognized the figure and wondered.
Scipio should have been out on his claim by this
time, like the rest.</p>
<p>The lean long figure of the lounger propped itself upon
its elbow. Curiously enough, lazy as he was, the smallest
matter interested him. Had he suddenly discovered a beetle
moving on the veranda he would have found food for reflection
in its doings. Such was his mind. A smile stole
into his indolent eyes, a lazy smile which spoke of tolerant
good-humor. He turned so that his voice might carry in
through the window which was just behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Bill,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;here&#8217;s Zip comin&#8217; down the trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>As though his announcement were sufficient to rouse an
equal interest in those inside the store, he returned again to
his contemplation of the approaching figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he doin&#8217; around camp this hour?&#8221; inquired a
harsh voice from beyond the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I ain&#8217;t a lightnin&#8217; calc&#8217;lator,&#8221; observed Sunny,
without withdrawing his gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; came the prompt retort from the invisible
speaker; &#8220;guess it &#8217;ud keep you busy trackin&#8217; a fun&#8217;ral.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which don&#8217;t need contradiction! I&#8217;m kind o&#8217; makin&#8217;
holiday these times. Guess you ain&#8217;t never heerd tell o&#8217; the
&#8216;rest cure&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>A rough laugh broke on the drowsy atmosphere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunny&#8217;s overworked just now,&#8221; said another voice,
amidst the rattle of poker chips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wher&#8217; you bin workin&#8217;, Sunny?&#8221; inquired the harsh
voice of the man addressed as Bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Workin&#8217;!&#8221; cried the loafer, with good-natured scorn.
&#8220;Say, I don&#8217;t never let a hobby interfere with the bizness
of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>A half-smothered laugh answered him. Even the exigencies
of a poker hand could not quite crush out the natural
humor of these men, who always followed on the golden
trail of the pioneers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, what&#8217;s your bizness?&#8221; demanded another voice
presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Restin&#8217;!&#8221; the man on the veranda answered easily.</p>
<p>The shuffle of cards and rattle of chips came with a
snigger. And the answering lazy smile of Sunny Oak was
good to see. It lit his unshaven face from his unwashed
brow to his chin. And to an onlooker it might well have
appeared a pity that an intense bodily indolence should so
dominate his personality. He looked vastly capable, both
mentally and physically.</p>
<p>But his eyes never left the on-coming Scipio. The little
man moved with bowed head and trailing footsteps. The
utter dispiritedness of his gait stirred even the self-centered
watcher. But Scipio saw nothing of Sunny Oak. He saw
nothing of anything but the despairing picture in his own
mind. The ramshackle shanties which lined one side of the
trail were passed unheeded. The yapping of the camp dogs
at the unusual sight of so deplorable a figure at this hour of
the day was quite unnoticed by him. The shelving rise of
attenuated grassland which blocked the view of Suffering
Creek on his left never for a moment came into his focus.
His eyes were on the trail ahead of him, and never more
than a few feet from where he trod. And those eyes were
hot and staring, aching with their concentration upon the
hideous picture which filled his brain.</p>
<p>As Scipio drew near Sunny Oak further bestirred himself,
which was a concession not often yielded by that individual
to anyone. He sat up, and his smile broadened.
Then it faded out as he beheld the usually mild expression
of the yellow-haired prospector now so set and troubled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; he murmured in an undertone. Then, with an
evident effort, he offered a greeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho, you, Zip! Drawn a blank way up ther&#8217; on your
mudbank?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio looked up in a dazed fashion. Then he halted and
seemed to pull himself together. Finally he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy?&#8221; he said in a mechanical sort of way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;m a heap better,&#8221; responded Sunny, with
twinkling eyes.</p>
<p>Scipio gazed up at the store in a bewildered way. He
saw the great letters in which Minky&#8217;s name and occupation
were inscribed on its pretentious front, and it seemed to
bring back his purpose to his distracted mind. Instantly the
other&#8217;s words became intelligible to him, and his native
kindliness prompted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You been sick?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, not rightly sick, but&ndash;&ndash;ailin&#8217;.&#8221; Sunny&#8217;s smile
broadened till a mouthful of fairly decent teeth showed
through the fringe of his ragged mustache.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ailin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep. Guess I bin overdoin&#8217; it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t do, working too hard in the heat,&#8221; said Scipio
absently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; replied Sunny. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a hard job avoidin&#8217; it.
Ther&#8217;s allus folk ready to set me workin&#8217;. That&#8217;s just the
way o&#8217; things. What I need is rest. Say, you ain&#8217;t
workin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio started.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m looking for Wild Bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny Oak jerked his head backwards in the direction of
the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess he&#8217;s at work&ndash;&ndash;in ther&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio mounted the veranda and passed along to the door
of the store. Sunny&#8217;s eyes followed him, but he displayed
no other interest. With ears and brain alert, however, he
waited. He knew that all he required to know would reach
him through a channel that was quite effortless to himself.
Again he stretched himself out on the bench, and his twinkling
eyes closed luxuriously.</p>
<p>Minky&#8217;s store was very little different from other places of
its kind. He sold everything that could possibly be needed
in a newly started mining camp. He did not confine himself
to hardware and clothing and canned goods, but carried a
supply of drugs, stationery and general dry goods, besides
liquor in ample quantities, if of limited quality. There was
rye whisky, there was gin, and there was some sort of
French brandy. The two latter were in the smallest
quantities. Rye was the staple drink of the place.</p>
<p>The walls of the store were lined with shelves on every
side, and the shelves were full, even overflowing to a piled-up
confusion of goods which were stacked around on the
floor. In the somewhat limited floor-space there were tables
and benches which could be used for the dual purpose of
drink and cards. But wherein Minky&#8217;s store was slightly
out of the usual was the fact that he was not a Jew, and
adopted no Jewish methods of trading. He was scrupulously
honest with his customers, and fairly moderate in his
charges, relying on this uncommon integrity and temperateness
of disposition to make personal liking the basis of his
commercial success.</p>
<p>It was perhaps a much further-sighted policy than one
would suppose. Several men had endeavored to start in the
store business in opposition to him, but in each case their
enterprise had proved an utter failure. Not a man in the
place would trade elsewhere. Minky was just &#8220;Minky,&#8221;
whom they liked and trusted. And, what was much more
to the point, who was ever ready to &#8220;trust&#8221; them.</p>
<p>Wild Bill was at the poker table with Minky, Sandy Joyce
and Toby Jenks when Scipio entered the place. He was a
gambler out and out. It was his profession. He was
known as Wild Bill of Abilene, a man whose past was never
inquired into by even the most youthful newcomer, whose
present was a thing that none ever saw sufficient reason to
question, and whose future suggested nothing so much as
the general uncertainty of things human. He was a man of
harsh exterior and, apparently, harsh purpose. His eyes
were steely and his tongue ironical; he possessed muscles of
iron and a knowledge of poker and all its subtleties that had
never yet failed him. He was a dead shot with a pistol, and,
in consequence, fear and respect were laid at his feet by his
fellow-townsmen. He was also Minky&#8217;s most treasured
friend.</p>
<p>Sandy Joyce had to his credit a married past, which somehow
gave him a certain authority in the place. He was
expected to possess a fund of wisdom in matters worldly,
and he did his best to live up to this demand. He was also,
by the way, an ex-cowpuncher suffering from gold fever,
and between whiles played poker with Wild Bill until he had
lost the result of his more regular labors. He was a slight,
tall, bright-eyed man of thirty, with an elaborate flow of
picturesque language. He was afraid of no man, but all
women.</p>
<p>Toby Jenks was as short and squat as his friends were
long and thin. He was good-tempered, and spent large
remittances which reached him at regular intervals in the
lulls which occurred in his desultory search for gold.</p>
<p>Minky, a plain, large man of blunt speech and gruff manners,
looked up swiftly as Scipio entered, and a moment
later three more pairs of eyes were fixed inquiringly upon
the newcomer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Struck color?&#8221; inquired Minky, with his gruffest
cordiality.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio&#8217;s entire attitude had distinctly undergone a change
since Sunny Oak&#8217;s lazy eyes first discovered his approach.
Where before the hopelessness of despair had looked out
from every line of his mild face, now his mouth was set
obstinately, and a decided thrust to his usually retiring chin
became remarkable. Even his wispy hair had an aggression
in the manner in which it obtruded from under the brim of
his slouch hat. His eyes were nearly defiant, yet there was
pleading in them, too. It was as if he were sure of the
rightness of his purpose, but needed encouragement in its
execution.</p>
<p>For the moment the poker game was stopped, a fact which
was wholly due to the interest of the steely eyes of Wild
Bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Layin&#8217; off?&#8221; inquired the gambler, without a moment&#8217;s
softening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;re passin&#8217; on that mud lay-out of yours,&#8221; suggested
Sandy, with a laugh.</p>
<p>Scipio shook his head, and his lips tightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I want to borrow a good horse from Bill here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gambler set down the cards he had been shuffling.
The statement seemed to warrant his action. He sat back
in his chair and bit a chew of tobacco off a black plug.
Minky and the others sat round and stared at the little man
with unfeigned interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re needin&#8217; a hoss?&#8221; demanded Bill, without attempting
to disguise his surprise. &#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio drew a hand across his brow; a beady sweat had
broken out upon it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing to bother folk with,&#8221; he said, with a painful
attempt at indifference. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to hunt around and find
that feller, &#8216;Lord&#8217; James.&#8221;</p>
<p>A swift glance flashed round the table from eye to eye.
Then Sunny Oak&#8217;s voice reached them from beyond the
window&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;ve a goodish ways to travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Time enough,&#8221; said Scipio doggedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you need to find him for?&#8221; demanded Wild
Bill, and there was a change in the glitter of his fierce
eyes. It was not that they softened, only now they had the
suggestion of an ironical smile, which, in him, implied curiosity.</p>
<p>Scipio shifted his feet uneasily. His pale eyes wandered
to the sunlit window. One hand was thrust in his jacket
pocket, and the fingers of it fidgeted with the rusty metal of
the gun that bulged its sides. This pressure of interrogation
was upsetting the restraint he was putting on himself. All
his grief and anger were surging uppermost again. With a
big effort, which was not lost upon his shrewd audience, he
choked down his rising emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;d like to pay him a &#8216;party call,&#8217;&#8221; he blurted
out.</p>
<p>Minky was about to speak, but Wild Bill kept him silent
with a sharp glance. An audible snigger came from beyond
the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you know jest wher&#8217; you&#8217;ll locate him?&#8221; inquired
the gambler.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I&#8217;m going to find him, sure,&#8221; replied Scipio
doggedly. Then he added, with his eyes averted, &#8220;Guess I
shan&#8217;t let up till I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a weak sparkle in the little man&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your game?&#8221; rasped Bill curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reply caused a brief embarrassed pause. Then the
gambler broke it with characteristic force.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; fer that reason you&#8217;re&ndash;&ndash;carryin&#8217; a gun,&#8221; he said,
pointing at the man&#8217;s bulging pocket.</p>
<p>Sandy Joyce ceased stacking his &#8220;chips&#8221;; Toby squared
his broad shoulders and drained an already empty glass.
Minky blinked his astonishment, while Wild Bill thrust his
long legs out and aggressively pushed his hat back on his
head. It was at that moment that curiosity overcame Sunny
Oak&#8217;s habitual indolence, and his face appeared over the
window-sill.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s stole from me,&#8221; said Scipio in a low tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he stole?&#8221; demanded the gambler savagely.</p>
<p>&#8220;My wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stillness of the room remained unbroken for some
moments. Actions came far easier to these men than mere
words. Scipio&#8217;s words had a paralyzing effect upon their
powers of speech, and each was busy with thoughts which
they were powerless to interpret into words. &#8220;Lord&#8221;
James was a name they had reason to hate. It was a name
synonymous with theft, and even worse&ndash;&ndash;to them. He had
stolen from their community, which was unforgivable, but
this&ndash;&ndash;this was something new to them, something which
did not readily come into their focus. Wild Bill was the
first to recover himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;How d&#8217;you know?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;She wrote telling me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She went &#8217;cos she notioned it?&#8221; inquired Sandy.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s stole her&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s stole my Jessie,&#8221; said Scipio sullenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to fetch her back?&#8221; Bill&#8217;s question
whipped the still air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;s mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio&#8217;s simplicity and single-mindedness brought forth a
sigh of intense feeling from his hearers.</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; Wild Bill&#8217;s method of interrogation had a
driving effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s mine, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m going to get her back.&#8221; There
was pity at the man&#8217;s obstinate assertion in every eye except
Wild Bill&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Zip, he&#8217;ll kill you,&#8221; said the gambler, after a
pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s my wife. She&#8217;s mine,&#8221; retorted Scipio intensely.
&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;ll shoot him dead if he refuses to hand her
over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; the gambler went on, ignoring the man&#8217;s protest&ndash;&ndash;the
idea of Scipio shooting a man like James was too ludicrous&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;you&#8217;re
up agin a bad proposition, sure. James has
stole your&ndash;&ndash;wife. He&#8217;s stole more. He&#8217;s a stage-robber.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A cattle-thief,&#8221; broke in Sandy.</p>
<p>&#8220;A &#8216;bad man&#8217; of the worst,&#8221; nodded Minky.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all these, an&#8217; more,&#8221; went on Bill, scowling.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a low-down skunk, he&#8217;s a pestilence, he&#8217;s a murderer.
You&#8217;re goin&#8217; to hunt him back ther&#8217; to his own shack in
the foothills with his gang of toughs around him, an&#8217; you&#8217;re
goin&#8217; to make him hand back your wife. Say, you&#8217;re sure
crazy. He&#8217;ll kill you. He&#8217;ll blow your carkis to hell, an&#8217;
charge the devil freightage for doin&#8217; it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a look of agreement in the eyes that watched
Scipio&#8217;s mild face. There was more: there was sympathy
and pity for him, feelings in these men for which there was
no other means of expression.</p>
<p>But Scipio was unmoved from his purpose. His underlip
protruded obstinately. His pale eyes were alight with
purpose and misery.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s stole my&ndash;&ndash;Jessie,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;an&#8217; I want her back.&#8221;
Then, in a moment, his whole manner changed, and his
words came with an irresistible pleading. Hard as was the
gambler, the pathos of it struck a chord in him the existence
of which, perhaps, even he was unaware.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll lend me a horse, Bill?&#8221; the little man cried.
&#8220;You will, sure? I got fifty dollars saved for the kiddies&#8217;
clothes. Here it is,&#8221; he hurried on, pulling out a packet of
bills from his hip pocket. &#8220;You take &#8217;em and keep &#8217;em
against the horse. It ain&#8217;t sufficient, but it&#8217;s all I got. I&#8217;ll
pay the rest when I&#8217;ve made it, if your horse gets hurted.
I will, sure. Say,&#8221; he added, with a happy inspiration, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
give you a note on my claim&ndash;&ndash;ha&#8217;f of it. You&#8217;ll do it?
You&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill&#8217;s face went suddenly scarlet. Something made him
lower his eyelids. It was as though he could not look on
that eager face unmoved any longer. Somehow he felt in a
vague sort of way that poor Scipio&#8217;s spirit was altogether too
big for his body. Bigger by far than that of those sitting
there ready to deride his purpose, and crush it to a weak
yielding such as, in their minds, was the only possible thing
for a man of his like.</p>
<p>&#8220;You set them bills right back in your dip,&#8221; he cried,
with a savageness that was only a mask to his real feelings;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t need &#8217;em. You ken get right out to the barn an&#8217;
have your pick o&#8217; my plugs, an&#8217; anythin&#8217; you need else.
Guess you best take the black mare. She&#8217;ll carry you all
day for a week, sure, an&#8217; then laff at you. Get right on, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;good
luck!&#8221;</p>
<p>There are actions performed in every man&#8217;s life for which
he can never account, even to himself. Such was the act
Wild Bill performed at that moment. Gambling was his
living, but his horses were a passion with him. He possessed,
perhaps, some of the finest in the country, and he
worshiped them. He had never been known to lend a
horse to his best friend, and no one but himself had ever
been allowed to feed or groom them. He was prouder of
them than a father might be of his firstborn son, and as
careful of them as any doting mother. Therefore his assent
to Scipio&#8217;s request was quite staggering to his companions.
Nor did he know why he did it, and a furious anger followed
immediately upon this unusual outburst of good-nature.</p>
<p>Scipio was profuse in his thanks. But he was cut short
with a violence that seemed quite unnecessary. For the
moment, at least, Bill hated the little man almost as much
as he hated this &#8220;Lord&#8221; James he was setting out in
search of.</p>
<p>After that no word passed until Scipio had left the store
for the barn. Bill sat wrapt in moody thought, his fierce
eyes lowered in contemplation of his well-shod feet. His
cards were forgotten, the men around him were forgotten.
Sandy and the storekeeper were watching his harsh face in
wonder, while Toby&#8217;s head was turned in the direction of
the departing man. It was Sunny Oak from his post at the
window who finally broke the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you gone plumb &#8216;bug,&#8217; Bill,&#8221; he said, with an
amiable grin. Then, as only a flicker of a smile from the
others answered him, and Bill ignored his charge altogether,
he hurried on, &#8220;You&#8217;re helpin&#8217; that misguided feller to a
dose of lead he&#8217;ll never have time to digest. If ever Zip
runs foul of James, he&#8217;ll blow him to hell as sure&ndash;&ndash;as ther&#8217;s
allus work for those as don&#8217;t need it. An&#8217;, wot&#8217;s more,
you&#8217;ll never set eyes on your black mare agin, &#8217;less it&#8217;s
under James&#8217; saddle. You&#8217;re sure &#8216;bug.&#8217; You oughter be
seen to.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was only Sunny Oak who would have dared to say so
much to the gambler. But then, for some unstated reason,
Sunny was a privileged person on Suffering Creek. Nobody
paid much attention to the manner in which he allowed his
tongue to run on, and, besides, he was too lazy to be afraid
of anybody.</p>
<p>Bill looked round.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re side-tracked,&#8221; he observed contemptuously.
&#8220;James won&#8217;t shoot Jessie&#8217;s husband. Maybe he&#8217;ll kick
him out, maybe he&#8217;ll roast him bad, and tongue-lash him.
Anyways, every man&#8217;s got to play his own hand. An&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s
good to see him playin&#8217; hard, win or lose. But Zip&#8217;ll git
back, sure. An&#8217; he&#8217;ll bring my mare with him. Go to
sleep, Sunny; your thinkin&#8217;-pan&#8217;s nigh hatched out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t guess he&#8217;ll ever get alongside James,&#8221; observed
Minky thoughtfully. &#8220;We&#8217;ve all looked for him a piece.
We know he&#8217;s got a shanty back in the foothills, but I don&#8217;t
seem to remember hearin&#8217; of anybody findin&#8217; it. I don&#8217;t
guess Zip&#8217;s wise to where it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill&#8217;s eyes lit with a curious fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess Zip&#8217;ll find him,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;ll
take him time&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217;,&#8221; cried Sunny, &#8220;how&#8217;s them pore kiddies to live
meanwhiles?&#8221;</p>
<p>The loafer fired his little bomb with the desired effect.
The men had no answer for some moments. And gradually
all eyes fixed themselves upon Bill&#8217;s face, as though acknowledging
his leadership. He answered the challenge in characteristic
fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess we&#8217;ll turn Sunny loose to wet-nurse &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>An announcement which set Sunny plunging headlong to
his own defense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, ain&#8217;t ther&#8217; no sort o&#8217; peace for a feller as needs
rest? You&#8217;re all mighty smart settin&#8217; folks to work. But
this is your game, Bill, an&#8217; it&#8217;s up to you to put it thro&#8217;.
I &#8217;low you&#8217;d make an elegant wet-nurse&ndash;&ndash;so soft and
motherish.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Bill had had enough, and turned upon the face at the
window in his most savage manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; he cried, with fierce irony, &#8220;we&#8217;ve all know&#8217;d
you since Sufferin&#8217; Creek was Sufferin&#8217; Creek, an&#8217; nobody
ain&#8217;t never kicked. But it&#8217;s kind o&#8217; ne&#8217;ssary for every feller
around these parts to justify &#8217;emselves. Get me? You
need &#8216;justifyin&#8217;.&#8217; Wal, I guess you&#8217;ll see to them kiddies
till Zip comes back. It&#8217;s going to be your work seein&#8217; they
don&#8217;t get fixed into any sort o&#8217; trouble, an&#8217; when Zip gets
back you&#8217;ll hand &#8217;em over clean an&#8217; fixed right. Get that?
I&#8217;m payin&#8217; for their board, an&#8217; I&#8217;m payin&#8217; you a wage. An&#8217;
you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to do it, or light right out o&#8217; here so quick your
own dust&#8217;ll choke you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, here!&#8221; cried Toby, with a delighted laugh.</p>
<p>Sandy grinned into the loafer&#8217;s angry face, while Minky
nodded an unsmiling approval.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, you beat hell for nerve!&#8221; cried Sunny.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I ken do better. I ken beat you,&#8221; retorted Bill
contemptuously. &#8220;You&#8217;ll do it, or&ndash;&ndash;you ken start gettin&#8217;
out now,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Sunny realized his position by the expression of the other
men&#8217;s faces, and, quickly resuming his good-humored plaint,
he acquiesced with a grumble.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! but it&#8217;s a tough world,&#8221; he complained, dropping
back on to his bench hurriedly, lest fresh demands should be
made upon him, and just in time to witness Scipio leading a
beautiful black mare up to the tying-post.</p>
<p>The men in the store turned out at the sound of horse&#8217;s
hoofs, and stood gathered on the veranda. Bill&#8217;s keen eyes
were fixed regretfully on the shining sides of his favorite
animal. She was a picture of lean muscle and bone, with a
beautiful small head, and ears that looked little larger than
well-polished mussel-shells. She stood pawing the ground
impatiently while Scipio tied her to the post, and she nuzzled
his ribs playfully with her twitching lips in the most friendly
spirit. But Bill&#8217;s eyes were suddenly arrested by the manner
in which she was saddled and bridled. Poor Scipio had
blundered in a hopeless fashion.</p>
<p>Other eyes, too, had seen the blunder, and Sandy Joyce
suddenly pointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mackinaw! Jest get that,&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Gee!&#8221; laughed Sunny.</p>
<p>But Wild Bill cut them all short in a surprising manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, guess you fellers ain&#8217;t never made no sort o&#8217; mistakes&ndash;&ndash;any
o&#8217; you. You&#8217;re laffin&#8217; a heap. Quit it, or&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
His eyes flashed dangerously. Then, as the men became
silent, he darted across to where Scipio was still fumbling
with the neck rope.</p>
<p>The little man&#8217;s attempt at saddling, under any other
circumstances, would have brought forth Bill&#8217;s most scathing
contempt. The saddle was set awry upon an ill-folded
blanket. It was so far back from the mare&#8217;s withers that
the twisted double cinchas were somewhere under her belly,
instead of her girth. Then the bit was reversed in her
mouth, and the curb-strap was hanging loose.</p>
<p>Bill came to his rescue in his own peculiar way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Zip,&#8221; he cried in a voice that nothing could soften,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t guess you altered them stirrups to fit you. I&#8217;ll jest
fix &#8217;em.&#8221; And the little man stood humbly by while he set
to work. He quickly unfastened the cinchas, and set the
blanket straight. Then he shifted the saddle, and refastened
the cinchas. Then he altered the stirrups, and passed on
to the mare&#8217;s bridle&ndash;&ndash;Scipio watching him all the while
without a word. But when the gambler had finished he
glanced up into his lean face with an almost dog-like gratitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, Bill,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I never done it before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I guessed.&#8221; And the gambler&#8217;s words, though wholly
harsh, had no other meaning in them. Then he went on,
as Scipio scrambled into the saddle, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to
worry any &#8217;bout things here. Your kiddies&#8217;ll be seen to
proper till you get back, if you&#8217;re on the trail a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio was startled. He had forgotten his twins.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Bill wanted no thanks or explanations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seein&#8217; to them things&ndash;&ndash;us, an&#8217; that all-fired lazy
slob, Sunny Oak. Ther&#8217; won&#8217;t be no harm&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He flicked
the restive mare, which bounded off with the spring of a
gazelle. &#8220;Ease your hand to her,&#8221; he called out, so as
to drown Scipio&#8217;s further protestations of gratitude, &#8220;ease
your hand, you blamed little fule. That&#8217;s it. Now let her
go.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the mare raced off in a cloud of dust.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>HUSBAND AND LOVER</h3>
</div>
<p>Where all the trail-wise men of Suffering Creek and
the district had failed, Scipio, the incompetent, succeeded.
Such was the ironical pleasure of the jade Fortune. Scipio
had not the vaguest idea of whither his quest would lead
him. He had no ideas on the subject at all. Only had he
his fixed purpose hard in his mind, and, like a loadstone, it
drew him unerringly to his goal.</p>
<p>There was something absolutely ludicrous in the manner
of his search. But fortunately there are few ready to laugh
at disaster. Thus it was that wherever he went, wherever
he paused amongst his fellows in search of information he
was received perfectly seriously, even when he told the object
of his search, and the story of its reason.</p>
<p>An ordinary man would probably have hugged such a
story to himself. He would have resorted to covert probing
and excuse in extracting information. But then it is
doubtful if, under such circumstances, his purpose would
have been so strong, so absolutely invincible as Scipio&#8217;s.
As it was, with single-minded simplicity, Scipio saw no reason
for subterfuge, he saw no reason for disguising the tragedy
which had befallen him. And so he shed his story
broadcast amongst the settlers of the district until, by means
of that wonderful prairie telegraphy, which needs no instruments
to operate, it flew before him in every direction,
either belittled or exaggerated as individual temperament
prompted.</p>
<p>At one ranch the news was brought in from the trail by
a hard-faced citizen who had little imagination, but much
knowledge of the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, fellers,&#8221; he cried, as he swung out of the saddle
at the bunkhouse door, &#8220;ther&#8217;s a tow-headed sucker on the
trail lookin&#8217; fer the James outfit. Guess he wants to shoot
&#8217;em up. He&#8217;s a sawed-off mutt, an&#8217; don&#8217;t look a heap like
scarin&#8217; a jack-rabbit. I told him he best git back to hum,
an&#8217; git busy fixin&#8217; his funeral right, so he wouldn&#8217;t have no
trouble later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wher&#8217;s he from?&#8221; someone asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sufferin&#8217; Creek,&#8221; replied the cowpuncher, &#8220;an&#8217; seems
to me he&#8217;s got more grit than savvee.&#8221;</p>
<p>And this opinion was more or less the general one. The
little man rode like one possessed, and it was as well that of
all his six treasured horses Wild Bill had lent him his
black beauty, Gipsy. She was quite untiring, and, with
her light weight burden, she traveled in a spirit of sheer
delight.</p>
<p>At every homestead or ranch Scipio only paused to make
inquiries and then hurried on. The information he received
was of the vaguest. James or some of his gang were often
seen in the remoter parts of the lower foothills, but this was
all. At one farm he had a little better luck, however.
Here he was told that the farmer had received an intimation
that if he wished to escape being burnt out he must be
prepared to hand over four hundred dollars when called
upon by the writer to do so; and the message was signed
&#8220;James.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So ye see,&#8221; said the farmer&ndash;&ndash;a man named Nicholls&ndash;&ndash;despondently,
&#8220;he&#8217;s som&#8217;eres skulkin&#8217; around hyar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems like it,&#8221; acquiesced Scipio.</p>
<p>Then, of a sudden, a suspicion flashed through the other&#8217;s
mind, and the man-hunter spent an uncomfortable few
seconds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you&#8217;re lookin&#8217; fer him?&#8221; the farmer questioned
harshly. Then he leant forward, his eyes lighting with
sudden anger. &#8220;If I tho&#8217;t you was&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Scipio&#8217;s mild blue eyes, and his simple reply had a
pacific effect at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking for him because he&#8217;s stole my wife. And
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; on chasin&#8217; till I find him.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was such mild sincerity in his visitor&#8217;s manner
that it was impossible for the farmer to retain his suspicion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you goin&#8217; to do about that four hundred?&#8221;
inquired Scipio later.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll get no dollars out o&#8217; me. I ain&#8217;t got &#8217;em,&#8221; replied
Nicholls hopelessly. Then his temper rose. &#8220;But I&#8217;m just
goin&#8217; to sleep with a gun to my hand, an&#8217; he&#8217;ll get it good
an&#8217; plenty, if he shoots the life out of me, an&#8217; burns every
stick I got, after.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio nodded sympathetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d feel that ways,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well, I guess I&#8217;ll be
gettin&#8217; on. My mare&#8217;ll be fed an&#8217; rested by this. Thanks
for the feed. Guess I&#8217;ll hunt around this district a piece.
Maybe I&#8217;ll find&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But suddenly the farmer awoke from the contemplation
of his own troubles and eyed the diminutive figure of his
guest wonderingly, as he stood up to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he observed critically, &#8220;guess you must be bustin&#8217;
with grit chasin&#8217; this feller.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, with a wan smile. &#8220;But he&#8217;s got&ndash;&ndash;my
wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah.&#8221;</p>
<p>And there was a world of understanding in the man&#8217;s
monosyllable.</p>
<p>Five minutes later the man-hunter was on the trail again.
It was the afternoon of the second day of his quest. He was
saddle-sore and weary, but his purpose knew no weakening.
Gipsy was going fresh and strong, and though she had already
traveled probably a hundred miles in her rider&#8217;s aimless
wanderings, she moved as though she was out for a
morning&#8217;s exercise on a liberal diet of oats.</p>
<p>True to his intention Scipio scoured the district with an
excess of enthusiasm which carried him far, and sundown
found him amongst the beehive hummocks which form the
approach to the greater hills. Up and down these wonderful
grassy dunes he roamed searching a resting-place for
himself and his mare. There was nothing of the sort in
sight, nothing but the endless series of grassy knolls, and
the dividing hollows which might conceal anything, from
a ranch house to an outlying cattle station. And finally
he abandoned all hope of shelter.</p>
<p>He had certainly lost himself. But, even so, he was not
greatly concerned. Why should he be? What did it matter?
He knew that if the worst came to the worst his
mare could eat her fill of grass, and, for himself, sleep in
the open had no terrors. Of food for himself he had not
even begun to think. So he rode on until the last blaze
of the setting sun dropped behind the sky-line.</p>
<p>He was descending into a hollow, something deeper than
usual. Hope ran high that it was one of those hidden
breaks, which, at intervals, cross the sea of grassy dunes,
and mark a mountain waterway. Nor was he disappointed.
A few moments later, to his delight, he found himself gazing
into the depths of one of the many rivulets trickling its
shallow way between low cut banks. Promptly he made
up his mind that it was the place for him to camp.</p>
<p>At the water&#8217;s edge he scrambled out of the saddle and
began to seek a place where his mare could drink. It was
a little difficult, for the banks were sharp, and the bushes
plentiful, and he had wandered at least a hundred yards in
his search for an opening when a human voice abruptly
hailed him from the far side of the stream. He looked
across without answering, and, to his intense surprise, beheld
a horseman on the opposite bank. The man, judging by
his appearance, was a cowpuncher, and, to Scipio&#8217;s simple
mind, was, like himself, benighted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; he replied at last, after a thoughtful stare.</p>
<p>The man was eyeing the yellow-headed figure with no
very friendly eyes, but this fact was lost upon Scipio, who
saw in him only a fellow man in misfortune. He saw the
lariat on the horn of the saddle, the man&#8217;s chapps, his hard-muscled
broncho pony gazing longingly at the water. The
guns at the man&#8217;s waist, the scowling brow and shifty eyes
passed quite unobserved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wher&#8217; you from?&#8221; demanded the man sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suffering Creek,&#8221; replied Scipio readily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;ve come quite a piece,&#8221; said the other, after
a considering pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you doin&#8217; here?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s inquiry rapped out smartly. But Scipio had
no suspicion of anybody, and answered quite without
hesitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m huntin&#8217; a man called James. You ain&#8217;t seen him?&#8221;</p>
<p>But the man countered his question with another.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scipio&ndash;&ndash;and yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the dying light the man&#8217;s saturnine features seemed to
relax for a moment into something like a smile. But he
spoke at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come right over,&#8221; he invited. &#8220;Guess my name&#8217;s Abe&ndash;&ndash;Abe
Conroy. I&#8217;m out chasin&#8217; cattle.&#8221; And the fact that
he finished up with a deliberate laugh had no meaning at all
for his companion.</p>
<p>Scipio gladly accepted the invitation, and, in response to
the man&#8217;s instructions, moved farther along the stream until
he came to a shelving in the bank where his mare could climb
down. He crossed over, letting his horse drink by the way,
and a few moments later was at his new acquaintance&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>The stranger&#8217;s mood seemed to have entirely changed
for the better by the time Scipio came up. His smile was
almost amiable, and his manner of speech was comparatively
jocular.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re chasin&#8217; that crook, James,&#8221; he said easily.
&#8220;Queer, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s run off a bunch of our stock. Leastways,
that&#8217;s how I&#8217;m guessin&#8217;. I&#8217;m makin&#8217; up to his place right
now to spy out things. I was jest waitin&#8217; fer the sun to go.
Y&#8217;see we&#8217;re organizin&#8217; a vigilance party to run&ndash;&ndash;Say, I&#8217;d
a notion fer a moment you was one of his gang.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Scipio disclaimed the honor promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I just need to find him. I&#8217;m needin&#8217; it bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wot fer?&#8221;</p>
<p>For once the man-hunter hesitated. A quite unaccountable
feeling gave him a moment&#8217;s pause. But he finally
answered frankly, as he always answered, with a simple
directness that was just part of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s stole my wife,&#8221; he said, his eyes directly gazing
into the other&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, he&#8217;s a low-down skunk,&#8221; declared the other, with a
curse. But the ironical light in his eyes quite escaped his
companion&#8217;s understanding.</p>
<p>Scipio was full of his good fortune in falling in with a
man who knew of James&#8217; whereabouts. A dozen questions
sprang into his mind, but he contented himself with stating
his intention.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ride on with you,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, right up to James&#8217; lay-out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. That&#8217;s wher&#8217; I&#8217;m makin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment the man calling himself Conroy sat gazing
out at the afterglow of the setting sun. His whole appearance
was ill-favored enough to have aroused distrust in
anybody but a man like Scipio. Now he seemed to be
pondering a somewhat vexed question, and his brows were
drawn together in a way that suggested anything but a clear
purpose. But finally he seemed to make up his mind to a
definite course. He spoke without turning to his companion,
and perhaps it was for the purpose of hiding a lurking
derisive smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re set on makin&#8217; James&#8217; shanty, you best come
right along. Only&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he hesitated for the barest fraction
of a second&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;y&#8217;see, I&#8217;m out after this cattle racket, an&#8217; I
guess I owe it to my folks to git their bizness thro&#8217; without
no chance of upset. See?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio nodded. He saw the man&#8217;s drift, and thought it
quite splendid of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I got to spy out things,&#8221; the man went on, &#8220;an&#8217;
if you get right up ther&#8217; first it&#8217;ll likely upset things fer me&ndash;&ndash;you
goin&#8217; ther&#8217; to hold him up as it were.&#8221; His smile
was more pronounced. &#8220;Now I guess I&#8217;ll show you where
his lay-out is if you&#8217;ll sure give me your promise to let me
hunt around fer ha&#8217;f-an-hour around his corrals&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;fore you
butt in. Then I&#8217;ll get right back to you an&#8217; you can go
up, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;shoot him to hell, if you notion that fancy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio almost beamed his thanks. The man&#8217;s kindness
seemed a noble thing to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a real bully fellow,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Guess we&#8217;ll start
right now?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man turned and his shrewd eyes fixed themselves
piercingly on the little man&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said shortly, &#8220;we&#8217;ll get on.&#8221;</p>
<p>He led the way, his horse slightly in advance of the mare,
and for some time he made no attempt to break the silence
that had fallen. The twilight was rapidly passing into the
deeper shadows of night, but he rode amongst the hills as
though he were traveling a broad open trail. There was no
hesitation, no questioning glance as to his direction. He
might have been traveling a trail that he had been accustomed
to all his life. At last, however, he glanced round at
his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, what you goin&#8217; to do when&ndash;&ndash;you get there?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fetch my wife back,&#8221; replied Scipio earnestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll James be doin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t keep her&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;s mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. But&ndash;&ndash;if he notions to keep her?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio was silent for some moments. His pale eyes were
staring straight ahead of him out into the growing darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe, I&#8217;ll have to shoot him,&#8221; he said at last, as though
there could be no question about the matter.</p>
<p>The man nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got useful guns?&#8221; he inquired casually.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, what is it? Magazine?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio pulled his antique possession out of his pocket and
handed it over for the man&#8217;s inspection.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Guess the sights ain&#8217;t good
over a distance, but at close range it&#8217;ll make a nasty hole.&#8221;</p>
<p>Conroy took the weapon in his hand. His keen eyes
noted the age of the pattern. He also saw the battered
condition of the sights, and the clumsy, rusted, protruding
hammer. It was six-chambered, and he knew that it must
be all of forty years old. One of the earliest pattern
revolvers. The sight of it filled him with cruel amusement,
but he kept a serious face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;lows that should bring James to his senses,&#8221; he
observed, as he handed it back to its owner.</p>
<p>Scipio read his answer as approval, and warmed towards
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d say so,&#8221; he said, returning his antiquity to his pocket.
&#8220;You see, a gun&#8217;s li&#8217;ble to rattle a feller like James. A
man who can get around when a feller&#8217;s back&#8217;s turned, an&#8217;
make love to his wife, ain&#8217;t much of a man, is he? I mean
he hasn&#8217;t much grit. He&#8217;s a coward sure. If he&#8217;d got grit
he wouldn&#8217;t do it. Well, that&#8217;s how I figger &#8217;bout this
James. He&#8217;s mean, an&#8217; a cowardly dog. I don&#8217;t guess I&#8217;ll
have to use that gun, but I jest brought it along to scare him
to his senses, if he needs it. Maybe though he won&#8217;t need
it when he sees me come along&ndash;&ndash;y&#8217;see, I&#8217;m Jessie&#8217;s husband&ndash;&ndash;guess
that&#8217;ll fix him sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you got James sized up good,&#8221; observed the man,
with his eyes fixed ahead. &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t see you&#8217;ll need
that gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode on, Scipio&#8217;s spirits rising with every yard they
traveled. He knew he was nearing his wife with every
passing moment. He had no doubts, no fears. So long as
he could reach her side he felt that all would be well. In
spite of her letter it never entered his head that she cared
for the man she had gone off with. He blamed James, and
it was no mere figure of speech when he said that he believed
he had &#8220;stolen&#8221; her. He believed such to be the case.
He believed she had gone unwillingly. In his mind it was
a case of abduction. Again and again he thanked Providence
that he had fallen in with this man, Conroy. He was
a good fellow, he told himself, a good friend. And his ideas
were so coincident with his own about James.</p>
<p>They were approaching the higher hills. Towering,
broken crags loomed ahead darkly in the gathering gloom.
The vast riven facets cut the sky-line, and black patches
of pine forests, and spruce, gave a ghostly, threatening outlook.
They must have been riding over two hours when
Scipio realized they were passing over a narrow cattle track
on the summit of a wooded hill. Then presently their
horses began a steep shelving descent which required great
caution to negotiate. And as they proceeded the darkness
closed in upon them, until they appeared to be making an
almost precipitate descent into a vast black pit. There was
no light here at all except for the stars above, for the last
glow of twilight was completely shut off by the great wall
they were now leaving behind them.</p>
<p>No word was spoken. Each man was busy with his horse,
and the animals themselves were stumbling and floundering
as they picked their uncertain way. A quarter of an hour
of this went by, then, suddenly, ahead, still farther down
the slope, two or three dim lights shone up at them like will-o&#8217;-the-wisps.
They seemed to dance about before Scipio&#8217;s
eyes as they rode. Nor, as he pointed them out to his companion,
did he realize that this peculiarity was due to the
motion of his mare under him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; replied Conroy dryly. &#8220;Them&#8217;s James&#8217; lights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got a large place,&#8221; said Scipio, with some awe in
his tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;He sure has,&#8221; agreed Conroy, smiling in the darkness.
&#8220;He&#8217;s got the biggest an&#8217; best-stocked ranch in Montana.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say he&#8217;s a&ndash;&ndash;cattle thief?&#8221; Scipio was struggling
to get things into proper focus.</p>
<p>&#8220;He sure is.&#8221; And Conroy&#8217;s tone of satisfaction had the
effect of silencing further comment by his companion.</p>
<p>A few moments later the descent was completed, and the
soft grass under her feet set Gipsy dancing to get on, but
Conroy pulled up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he said authoritatively, &#8220;you set right here while
I get on an&#8217; get thro&#8217; with my business. I&#8217;ll come along
back for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without demur Scipio waited, and his companion vanished
in the darkness. The little man had entered into an
agreement, and had no desire, in spite of his eagerness to be
doing, of departing from the letter of it. So he possessed
himself in what patience he could until Conroy&#8217;s return.</p>
<p>The soft pad of the retiring horse&#8217;s hoofs on the thick
grass died away. And presently one of the twinkling lights
ahead was abruptly shut out. The horseman had intervened
on Scipio&#8217;s line of vision. Then the yellow gleam as suddenly
reappeared, and the last sign of Conroy passed. The
waiting man watched with every faculty alert. His ears and
eyes straining for the least unusual sound or sight. But
there was none forthcoming.</p>
<p>Then he began to think. He began to consider the
situation. He began to picture to himself something of the
scene that he hoped would shortly take place between himself
and the man James. It was the first time he had
thought of the matter deliberately, or attempted to estimate
its possibilities. Hitherto he had been too torn by his emotions
to consider anything in detail. And, even now, so
imbued was he with the right of his cause that he only saw
his own point of view, which somehow made James a mere
plaything in his hands.</p>
<p>He found himself dictating his will upon the thief in firm
tones. He demanded his wife without heat, but with the
knowledge of the power of his gun lying behind his words.
He felt the restraint he would use. He would not bully.
Who was he to bully after having had Jessie restored to
him? James should be dealt with as gently as his feelings
would permit him. Yes, thank God, he had no actual desire
to hurt this man who had so wronged him. The man was
foolish, and he could afford to be generous, having had
Jessie restored to him. No, he would try hard to forgive
him. It would be a tremendous struggle, he knew, yet he
felt, with Jessie restored to him, he ought to make the effort.
Somehow, even now, he almost felt sorry for so misguided
a&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>But his reflections were suddenly cut short by the sound
of horses&#8217; hoofs returning, and, a moment later, Conroy
loomed up in the darkness. He came quite close up before
he spoke, and then it was almost in a whisper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve located things,&#8221; he said, with an air of deep satisfaction.
&#8220;Guess we&#8217;ll make Mr. &#8216;Lord&#8217; James hunt his
hole &#8217;fore we&#8217;re thro&#8217; with him. I figger a rawhide fixed
neat about his neck&#8217;ll &#8217;bout meet his case. An&#8217; say, I&#8217;ve
news fer you. Ther&#8217;s some o&#8217; his boys around. He&#8217;s jest
right in ther&#8217; wher&#8217; you ken see that biggish light,&#8221; he went
on, pointing at the illuminated square of a window. &#8220;I see
him through an open door round back. He&#8217;s lyin&#8217; on a
heap o&#8217; blankets readin&#8217; a book. Ef you git along now
you&#8217;ll get him wher&#8217; you need him, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I wouldn&#8217;t take
no chances. Get a drop on him from outside the door, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;wal,
guess a feller like you&#8217;ll know what to do after that.
I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; back to home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio glowed. He felt he could have hugged this good-natured
stranger. But he did not altogether agree with the
man&#8217;s suggestion of getting the drop on James. He felt it
would hardly be playing the game. However, he intended
to be guided by circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, friend,&#8221; he said, in his simple fashion. &#8220;You
must let me call you that,&#8221; he went on eagerly. &#8220;You
see, you&#8217;ve done something for me to-night I can&#8217;t never
forget. Maybe you&#8217;ve got a wife of your own, and if so
you&#8217;ll sure understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t rightly say I&#8217;ve got a&ndash;&ndash;wife,&#8221; the man replied,
&#8220;but I ken understan&#8217; all right. James is low&ndash;&ndash;doggone
low,&#8221; he added. And his face was turned well away so
that he could grin comfortably without fear of the other
seeing it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, so long,&#8221; said Scipio hastily. &#8220;Seeing I shan&#8217;t
see you here when I get back, I&#8217;d just like to thank you
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So long,&#8221; replied the other. &#8220;An&#8217; you needn&#8217;t to thank
me too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio urged his mare forward, and the man sat looking
after him. And somehow his face had lost something of its
satisfied expression. However, he sat there only a moment.
Presently he lifted his reins and set his horse at a canter in
the direction of one of the more distant lights.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a pore fule,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;but it&#8217;s a lousy trick
anyways.&#8221; Thus he dismissed the matter from his mind
with a callous shrug.</p>
<p>In the meantime Scipio neared the house from which
shone the larger light. As he drew towards it he saw its
outline against the starlight. It was a large, two-storied
frame house of weather-boarding, with a veranda fronting
it. There were several windows on the hither side of it, but
light shone only in one of them. It was by this light the
horseman saw a tie-post some yards from the house. And
without hesitation he rode up to it, and, dismounting, secured
his mare. Then, following Conroy&#8217;s directions, he proceeded
on foot to the back of the house where he was to
find an open door. He turned the angle of the building.
Yes, the door was there all right, but whereas Conroy had
said that James was lying on his blankets reading, he now
discovered that the doorway was filled by that handsome
thief&#8217;s presence.</p>
<p>Before he realized what had happened, Scipio found himself
in the full glare of the light from the doorway, and
James was smiling down upon his yellow head with a
curious blending of insolence and curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was wondering when you&#8217;d get around,&#8221; he said, without
shifting his position. Then, as Scipio made no answer,
he bestirred himself. &#8220;Come right in,&#8221; he added, and,
lounging out of the doorway, he dropped back into the room.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll find things a bit untidy,&#8221; he went on calmly, &#8220;you
see I&#8217;m making changes in my domestic arrangements.
This is temporary, I guess. However, if you don&#8217;t just
mind that, why&ndash;&ndash;come right in.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s whole manner was one of good-humored
indifference. There was an unruffled assurance about him
that was quite perfect, if studied. Scipio&#8217;s presence there
seemed the last thing of concern to him. And the effect of
his manner on his visitor entirely upset all the latter&#8217;s preconceived
intentions. Astonishment was his first feeling.
Then a sudden diffidence seized him, a diffidence that was
nearly akin to fear of his rival. But this passed in a moment,
and was instantly replaced by a hot rush of blood
through his small body. All his pictured interview died out
of his recollections, and, in place of that calmness with
which he had intended to meet the man, he found his pulses
hammering and hot anger mounting to his head. The
commonest of human passions stirred in him, and he felt
it would be good to hurt this man who had so wronged
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s my wife?&#8221; he demanded, with a sudden
fierceness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s that. Say, come right in?&#8221;</p>
<p>James was still smiling pleasantly. This time Scipio
accepted the invitation without thought of trap or anything
else. He almost precipitated himself into the room.</p>
<p>Nor in his fury did he observe his surroundings. He had
no eyes for the furnishings, the cheap comfort with which
he was surrounded. And though, as James had said, the
place was untidy, he saw nothing and none of it. His eyes
were on the man; angry, bloodshot eyes, such eyes as those
of a furiously goaded dog, driven into a corner by the cruel
lash of a bully&#8217;s whip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it. Wher&#8217;s my wife?&#8221; Scipio demanded
threateningly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve stole her, and taken her from me.
I&#8217;ve come to take her back.&#8221;</p>
<p>The force of his demands was tinged with the simplicity
of a naturally gentle disposition. And maybe, in consequence,
something of their sting was lost. The forceful
bluster of an outraged man, determined upon enforcing his
demands, would probably have stirred James to active protest,
but, as it was, he only continued to smile his insolence
upon one whom he regarded as little better than a harmless
worm.</p>
<p>&#8220;One moment,&#8221; he said, with an exasperating patience,
&#8220;you say I stole her. To have stolen her suggests that she
was not willing to come along. She came with me. Well,
I guess she came because she fancied it. You say you&#8217;re
going to take her back. Well,&#8221; with a shrug, &#8220;I kind of
think she&#8217;ll have something to say about going back.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Scipio stood aghast. He glanced about
him helplessly. Then, in a flash, his pale-blue eyes came
back to the other&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s mine, I tell you! Mine! Mine! Mine!&#8221; he
cried, in a frenzy of rage and despair. &#8220;She&#8217;s mine by the
laws of God an&#8217; man. She&#8217;s mine by the love that has
brought our kiddies into the world. Do you hear? She&#8217;s
mine by every tie that can hold man and wife together. An&#8217;
you&#8217;ve stole her. She&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got. She&#8217;s all I want. She&#8217;s
just part of me, and I can&#8217;t live without her. Ther&#8217;s the
kiddies to home waitin&#8217; for her, and she&#8217;s theirs, same as
they are hers&ndash;&ndash;and mine. I tell you, you ain&#8217;t going to
keep her. She&#8217;s got to come back.&#8221; He drew a deep breath
to choke down his fury. &#8220;Say,&#8221; he went on, with a sudden
moderating of his tone and his manner, taking on a pitiful
pleading, &#8220;do you think you love her? You? Do you
think you know what love is? You don&#8217;t. You can&#8217;t.
You can&#8217;t love her same as I do. I love her honest. I love
her so I want to work for her till I drop. I love her so
there&#8217;s nothin&#8217; on earth I wouldn&#8217;t do for her. My life is
hers. All that&#8217;s me is hers. I ain&#8217;t got a thought without
her. Man, you don&#8217;t know what it is to love my Jessie.
You can&#8217;t, &#8217;cos your love&#8217;s not honest. You&#8217;ve taken her
same as you&#8217;d take any woman for your pleasure. If I was
dead, would you marry her? No, never, never, never.
She&#8217;s a pastime to you, and when you&#8217;ve done with her you&#8217;d
turn her right out on this prairie to herd with the cattle,
if ther&#8217; wasn&#8217;t anywher&#8217; else for her to go.&#8221; Then his voice
suddenly rose and his fury supervened again. &#8220;God!&#8221; he
cried fiercely. &#8220;Give me back my wife. You&#8217;re a thief.
Give her back to me, I say. She&#8217;s mine, d&#8217;you understand&ndash;&ndash;mine!&#8221;</p>
<p>Not for an instant did the smile on James&#8217; face relax.
Maybe it became more set, and his lips, perhaps, tightened,
but the smile was there, hard, unyielding in its very setness.
And when Scipio&#8217;s appeal came to an end he spoke with an
underlying harshness that did not carry its way to the little
man&#8217;s distracted brain.</p>
<p>&#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t go back to you, even if I let her&ndash;&ndash;which
I won&#8217;t,&#8221; he said coldly.</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s words seemed to bite right into the heart of
his hearer. Nothing could have been better calculated to
goad him to extremity. In one short, harsh sentence he had
dashed every hope that the other possessed. And with a
rush the stricken man leapt at denial, which was heartrending
in its impotence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You lie!&#8221; he shouted. The old revolver was dragged
from his pocket and pointed shakingly at his tormentor&#8217;s
head. &#8220;Give her back to me! Give her back, or&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>James&#8217; desperate courage never deserted him for an instant.
And Scipio was never allowed to complete his sentence.
The other&#8217;s hand suddenly reached out, and the
pistol was twisted from his shaking grasp with as little
apparent effort as though he had been a small child.</p>
<p>Scipio stared helpless and confused while James eyed the
pattern of the gun. Then he heard the man&#8217;s contemptuous
laugh and saw him pull the trigger. The hammer refused
to move. It was so rusted that the weapon was quite useless.
For a moment the desperado&#8217;s eyes sought the pale
face of his would-be slayer. A devilish smile lurked in their
depths. Then he held out the pistol for the other to take,
while his whole manner underwent a hideous change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, take it, you wretched worm,&#8221; he cried, with
sudden savagery. &#8220;Take it, you miserable fool,&#8221; he added,
as Scipio remained unheeding. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t blow even
your fool brains out. Take it!&#8221; he reiterated, with a command
the other could no longer resist. &#8220;And now get out
of here,&#8221; he went on mercilessly, as Scipio&#8217;s hand closed over
the wretched weapon, &#8220;or I&#8217;ll hand you over to the boys.
They&#8217;ll show you less mercy than I do. They&#8217;re waiting
out there,&#8221; he cried, pointing at the door, &#8220;for my orders.
One word from me and they&#8217;ll cut the liver out of you with
rawhides, and Abe Conroy&#8217;ll see it&#8217;s done right. Get you
right out of here, and if ever you come squealing around
my quarters again I&#8217;ll have you strung up by your wretched
neck till you&#8217;re dead&ndash;&ndash;dead as a crushed worm&ndash;&ndash;dead as
is your wife, Jessie, to you from now out. Get out of here,
you straw-headed sucker, get right out, quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the tide of the man&#8217;s fury seemed to utterly pass the
little man by. He made no attempt to obey. The pistol
hung in his tightly gripping hand, and his underlip protruded
obstinately.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s mine, you thief!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Give her back to
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the cry of a beaten man whose spirit is
unquenchable.</p>
<p>But James had finished. All that was worst in him was
uppermost now. With eyes blazing he stepped to the door
and whistled. He might have been whistling up his dogs.
Perhaps those who responded were his dogs. Three men
came in, and the foremost of them was Abe Conroy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; cried James, his cruel eyes snapping, &#8220;take him
out and set him on his horse, and send him racing to hell
after m&#8217;squitoes. And don&#8217;t handle him too easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>What happened to him after that Scipio never fully understood.
He had a vague memory of being seized and buffeted
and kicked into a state of semi-unconsciousness. Nor did he
rouse out of his stupor, until, sick and sore in every limb,
his poor yellow head aching and confused, he found himself
swaying dangerously about in the saddle, with Gipsy, racing
like a mad thing, under his helpless legs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>SUNNY OAK PROTESTS</h3>
</div>
<p>Wild Bill was gazing out across the camp dumps. His
expression suggested the contemplation of a problem of life
and death, and a personal one at that. Sandy Joyce, too,
bore traces suggestive of the weightiest moments of his life.
Toby Jenks stood chewing the dirty flesh of a stubby forefinger,
while the inevitable smile on Sunny Oak&#8217;s face made
one think of a bright spring morning under cover of a yellow
fog.</p>
<p>&#8220;How am I to see to them pore kiddies?&#8221; the latter was
complaining. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had to do with cattle, an&#8217; mules, an&#8217;
even hogs in my time, but I sure don&#8217;t guess you ken set
them bits o&#8217; mites in a brandin&#8217; corral, nor feed &#8217;em oats an&#8217;
hay, nor even ladle &#8217;em swill for supper, like hogs. Fer
other things, I don&#8217;t guess I could bile a bean right without
a lib&#8217;ry o&#8217; cook-books, so how I&#8217;m to make &#8217;em elegant pap
for their suppers &#8217;ud beat the Noo York p&#8217;lice force. An&#8217;
as fer fixin&#8217; their clothes, an&#8217; bathing &#8217;em, why, it &#8217;ud set
me feelin&#8217; that fulish you wouldn&#8217;t know me from a patient
in a bug-house. It makes me real mad, folks is allus astin&#8217;
me to get busy doin&#8217; things. I&#8217;m that sick, the sight of a
ha&#8217;f-washened kid &#8217;ud turn my stummick to bile, an&#8217; set me
cacklin&#8217; like a hen with a brood o&#8217; ducklings she can&#8217;t no
ways account fer. You&#8217;se fellers are a happy lot o&#8217; Jonahs
to a man as needs rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure doing the cacklin&#8217; now,&#8221; observed Bill contemptuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s layin&#8217; eggs,&#8221; murmured Toby vaguely.</p>
<p>The men were standing on the veranda, gathered round
the bench on which Sunny Oak was still resting his indolent
body. And the subject of their discourse was Scipio&#8217;s two
children. The father had ridden off on his search for James,
and the responsibility of his twins was weighing heavily on
those left behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kind o&#8217; handy ladlin&#8217; it out to folks,&#8221; said Sunny, grinning
lazily. &#8220;But, with all your brightness, I don&#8217;t guess any
o&#8217; you could mother them kiddies. No, it&#8217;s jest &#8217;send Sunny
along to see to &#8217;em.&#8217; That bein&#8217; said, you&#8217;ll git right back
to your poker with a righteous feelin&#8217; which makes it come
good to rob each other all you know. Psha! You ain&#8217;t
no better&#8217;n them lousy birds as lays eggs sizes too big, an&#8217;
blames &#8217;em on to some moultin&#8217; sparrer that ain&#8217;t got
feathers &#8217;nuff to make it welcome at a scratchin&#8217; bee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny&#8217;s flow was a little overwhelming, and perhaps there
was just enough truth in his remarks to make it unadvisable
for the others to measure wits with him. Anyway, he received
no reply. Bill continued to gaze out at Scipio&#8217;s hut
in a way that suggested great absorption, while Toby had
not yet lunched sufficiently off his tattered forefinger.
Sandy was the only one of the three apparently alive to the
true exigencies of the case, and Sunny addressed himself
more exclusively to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he went on, his good-humored eyes smiling cunningly
up into the widower&#8217;s face, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heerd tell that you
once did some pore unsuspicious female the dirty trick of
marryin&#8217; her. Mebbe you&#8217;ll sure hev&#8217; notions &#8217;bout kiddies
an&#8217; such things. Now, if Wild Bill had come along an&#8217;
pushed a shootin&#8217;-iron into your map, an&#8217; said you&#8217;ll handle
Zip&#8217;s kiddies&ndash;&ndash;wal, I ask you, wot &#8217;ud you ha&#8217; done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Told him to git his head cooled some,&#8221; retorted Sandy
promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, guess you bin saved a heap o&#8217; trouble,&#8221; murmured
Sunny. &#8220;But if you hadn&#8217;t said that&ndash;&ndash;which you said you
would ha&#8217; said&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; you&#8217;d got busy as he suggested&ndash;&ndash;wal,
what then?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy cleared his throat, and, in his sudden interest, Toby
deferred the rest of his meal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, I&#8217;d ha&#8217; gone right up to the shack an&#8217; looked into
things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy&#8217;s first effort seemed to please him, and, hitching his
moleskin trousers up deliberately, he proceeded with some
unction&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y&#8217;see, ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; like gettin&#8217; a look around.
Then you kind o&#8217; know wher&#8217; you are. You sure need to
know wher&#8217; you are &#8217;fore you get busy proper. It&#8217;s most
like everything else. If you get on the wrong trail at the
start, it&#8217;s li&#8217;ble to lead you wher&#8217; you don&#8217;t want to go.
What I says is, hit the right trail at the start, then you got
a chance o&#8217; gettin&#8217; thro&#8217; right, which, I take it, is an elegant
way o&#8217; doin&#8217; most things. Wal, havin&#8217; located the right
trail&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re talkin&#8217; o&#8217; Zip&#8217;s twins,&#8221; murmured Sunny gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; to&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By trail?&#8221; inquired Toby seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you make me tired,&#8221; retorted Sandy angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Best quit the trail, then,&#8221; said Sunny.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to blazes!&#8221; cried Sandy, and promptly relapsed into
moody silence.</p>
<p>At that moment Bill turned from his contemplation of the
house beyond the dumps and fixed his fierce eyes on Sunny&#8217;s
grinning face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, you miser&#8217;ble hoboe,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;get right up out
of that, and hump across to Zip&#8217;s shack. You&#8217;re doin&#8217;
enough gassin&#8217; fer a female tattin&#8217; bee. Your hot air makes
me want to sweat. Now, them kiddies&#8217;ll need supper.
You&#8217;ll jest ast Minky fer all you need, an&#8217; I pay. An&#8217; you&#8217;ll
see things is fixed right for &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny lurched reluctantly to his feet. He knew the
gambler far too well to debate the point further. He had
made his protest, which had been utterly ineffective, so there
was nothing left him but to obey the fiercely uttered mandate.</p>
<p>But Sandy Joyce felt that somehow his first effort on
behalf of the children had missed fire, and it was his duty
not to allow himself to be ousted from the council. So he
stayed the loafer with a word.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you&#8217;ll be knowin&#8217; how to feed &#8217;em?&#8221; he inquired
gravely.</p>
<p>Sunny&#8217;s eyes twinkled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, mebbe you ken give me pointers,&#8221; he retorted, with
apparent sincerity.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how I was figgerin&#8217;,&#8221; said Sandy cordially. He
felt better now about his first effort. &#8220;Y&#8217;see, Minky&#8217;s stock
is limited some; ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t a heap o&#8217; variety, like. An&#8217; kiddies
do need variety. Y&#8217;see, they&#8217;re kind o&#8217; delicate feeders,
same as high-bred hosses, an&#8217; dogs an&#8217; things. Now, dogs
need diff&#8217;rent meat every day, if you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to bring &#8217;em
up right. A friend o&#8217; mine sure once told me that meat,
good meat, was the best feed fer prize dogs, an&#8217; he was a
feller that won a heap o&#8217; prizes. He had one, Boston bull,
I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;ll I need to git dog-biscuit for them kiddies?&#8221; inquired
Sunny sarcastically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you make me sick,&#8221; cried Sandy, flushing
angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess that&#8217;s how you&#8217;ll make them kiddies,&#8221; interposed
Toby.</p>
<p>Sandy glanced viciously from one to the other. Then,
assuming a superiority that scarcely hid his chagrin, he
ignored the interruptions.</p>
<p>&#8220;You best ast Minky fer some dandy canned truck,&#8221; he
said decisively, deliberately turning his back on Toby Jenks.
&#8220;Mebbe a can o&#8217; lobster an&#8217; one o&#8217; them elegant tongues
stewed in jelly stuff, an&#8217; set in a glass bowl. Y&#8217;see, they
kids needs nourishin&#8217;, an&#8217; that orter fix them &#8217;bout right. I
don&#8217;t know &#8217;bout them new sides o&#8217; sow-belly Minky&#8217;s jest
had in. Seems to me they&#8217;ll likely need teeth eatin&#8217; that.
Seein&#8217; you ain&#8217;t a heap at fixin&#8217; beans right, we best cut that
line right out&ndash;&ndash;though I &#8217;lows there&#8217;s elegant nourishin&#8217;
stuff in &#8217;em for bosses. Best get a can o&#8217; crackers an&#8217; some
cheese. I don&#8217;t guess they&#8217;ll need onions, nor pickles. But
a bit o&#8217; butter to grease the crackers with, an&#8217; some molasses
an&#8217; fancy candy, an&#8217; a pound o&#8217; his best tea seems to me &#8217;bout
right. After that&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some hoss physic,&#8221; broke in Toby, recommencing the
chewing of his forefinger.</p>
<p>But Wild Bill&#8217;s fierce eyes were on Sandy, and the erstwhile
married man felt their contempt boring into his very
soul. He was held silent, in spite of his anger against the
broad-shouldered Toby, and was possessed of a feeling that
somehow his second effort had been no more successful than
his first. And forthwith the impression received confirmation
in a sudden explosion from Wild Bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jumpin&#8217; mackinaw!&#8221; he cried, with a force calculated
to crush entirely the remnants of Sandy&#8217;s conceit. &#8220;You&#8217;d
sure shame a crazy sheep fer intellect.&#8221; Then he added,
with withering sarcasm, &#8220;Say, don&#8217;t you never leave your
mouth open more&#8217;n two seconds at a time, or you&#8217;ll get the
flies in it, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;ll start nestin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then without pause he turned on Sunny and delivered
his ultimatum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get busy,&#8221; he ordered in a tone there was no denying.</p>
<p>And somehow Sunny found himself stirring far more
rapidly than suited his indolent disposition.</p>
<p>Having thoroughly disturbed the atmosphere to his liking,
Bill left the veranda without another look in his companions&#8217;
direction, and his way took him to the barn at the back of
the store.</p>
<p>The gambler was a man of so many and diverse peculiarities
that it would be an impossibility to catalogue them with
any degree of satisfactoriness. But, with the exception of
his wholesale piratical methods at cards&ndash;&ndash;indeed, at any
kind of gambling&ndash;&ndash;perhaps his most striking feature was
his almost idolatrous worship for his horses. He simply
lived for their well-being, and their evident affection for
himself was something that he treasured far beyond the gold
he so loved to take from his opponents in a gamble.</p>
<p>He possessed six of these horses, each in its way a jewel
in the equine crown. Wherever the vagaries of his gambler&#8217;s
life took him his horses bore him thither, harnessed to
a light spring cart of the speediest type. Each animal had
cost him a small fortune, as the price of horses goes, and for
breed and capacity, both in harness and under saddle, it
would have been difficult to find their match anywhere in the
State of Montana. He had broken and trained them himself
in everything, and, wherever he was, whatever other
claims there might be upon him, morning, noon and evening
he was at the service of his charges. He gloried in them.
He reveled in their satin coats, their well-nourished, muscular
bodies, in their affection for himself.</p>
<p>Now he sat on an oat-bin contemplating Gipsy&#8217;s empty
stall, with a regret that took in him the form of fierce anger.
It was the first time since she had come into his possession
that she had been turned over to another, the first time
another leg than his own had been thrown across her; and
he mutely upbraided himself for his folly, and hated Scipio
for having accepted her services. Why, he asked himself
again and again, had he been such an unearthly fool? Then
through his mind flashed a string of blasphemous invective
against James, and with its coming his regret at having lent
Gipsy lessened.</p>
<p>He sat for a long time steadily chewing his tobacco. And
somehow he lost all desire to continue his poker game in the
store. His whole mind had become absorbed by thoughts of
this James, and though he, personally, had never suffered
through the stage-robber&#8217;s depredations, he found himself
resenting the man&#8217;s very existence. There were no ethical
considerations in his mind. His inspiration was purely personal.
And though he did not attempt to reduce his hatred
to reason, nor to analyze it in any way, the truth of its
existence lay in the fact of a deadly opposition to this sudden
rise to notoriety of a man of strength, and force of character
similar, in so many respects, to his own. Perhaps it was
mere jealousy; perhaps, all unknown to himself, there was
some deeper feeling underlying it. Whatever it was, he had
a strong sympathy with Scipio, and an unconquerable desire
to have a hand in the smoothing out of the little man&#8217;s
troubles.</p>
<p>He did not leave the barn, and scarcely even took his eyes
off Gipsy&#8217;s empty stall, until nearly sundown. Then, as he
heard the voices of returning prospectors, he set to work on
his evening task of grooming, feeding, watering and bedding
down his children for the night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>SUNNY OAK TRIES HIS HAND</h3>
</div>
<p>In the meantime Sunny Oak was executing his orders
with a care for detail quite remarkable in a man of his excessive
indolence. It was a curious fact, and one that told a
great deal of his own character, as well as that of the gambler.
His implicit obedience to Wild Bill&#8217;s orders was born
of a deeper knowledge of that individual than was possessed
by most of his comrades in Suffering Creek. Maybe Minky,
who was Bill&#8217;s most intimate friend, would have understood.
But then Sunny Oak possessed no such privilege. He knew
Bill through sheer observation, which had taught him to
listen when the gambler spoke as he would listen to a man
in high authority over him&ndash;&ndash;or to a man who, without
scruple, held him helpless under an irresistible threat.
Which power it was inspired his obedience he did not pause
to consider. He simply accepted the fact that when Bill
ordered he preferred to obey&ndash;&ndash;it was so much easier.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoboe&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;the local term for one suffering from his
indolent malady&ndash;&ndash;as he was, Sunny Oak was a man of some
character. Originally this cloak of indolence in which he
wrapped himself had been assumed for some subtle reason
of his own. It was not the actual man. But so long had he
worn it now that he had almost forgotten the real attributes
enshrouded in its folds. As a matter of fact, he was very
much a man, and a &#8220;live&#8221; man, too. He really possessed
an extraordinary energy when he chose to exercise it. But
it was generally his habit to push his interest aside for the
easier course of indifference. However, his capacity was
none the less there.</p>
<p>His other possessions, too, were excellent in their way,
although he had encouraged the germ of rust in a deplorable
degree. His good-nature would not be denied, and was
obvious to all. But an extremely alert mind, an infinite
resource of keen, well-trained thought, a profound love of
the beautiful, a more commonplace physical courage supported
by the rarer moral courage, he contrived to keep well
hidden from the vulgar gaze.</p>
<p>These were some of the features so long concealed under
the folds of his cloak of indolence that even he had almost
forgotten their existence. Thus it was, in all seriousness, he
cried out bitterly in protest when an attempt was made to
lift the covering and lay bare the man beneath it. And his
lamentations were perfectly genuine.</p>
<p>After leaving the store with a sack of provisions over his
shoulder he grumbled his way across the dumps to Scipio&#8217;s
house. He cursed the weight he was forced to carry, and
anathematized the man who had driven him to so bestir
himself. He lamented over this waste of his precious
energies, he consigned Scipio and his children to eternity,
and metaphorically hurled Jessie headlong to the depths of
the uttermost abyss of the nether-world. But he went on.
In spite of his foulest language and vilest epithets, it was
his full intention to do his best for the children.</p>
<p>What he found on entering Scipio&#8217;s hut set his small eyes
twinkling again. His unclean face creased up into a grin,
and, softly tiptoeing to a far corner of the room, he deposited
his sack with the greatest care. Then he stood up,
and his eyes fixed themselves on a curious heap under the
table. It was a tumbled pile of pale blue, dirty white, with
a four-legged dash of yellow. And out of the heap he made
the forms of two small sleeping children, each hugging in
their arms an extremity of a yellow cur pup, also sound
asleep, in the shaft of sunlight which flooded in through the
open doorway.</p>
<p>Sunny rubbed his eyes and thought hard, nor did he find
the process irksome. From the miserable camp pup he
glanced at the grubby face of Jamie. Then his eyes passed
on to Vada&#8217;s pretty but equally dirty features. And swift
action at once followed his thought. He glanced at the
dying fire in the cookstove, and saw the small clothes hanging
on the chair in front of it. He felt them; they were
quite dry. Then he tried the kettle on the stove; it still had
water in it. Then he went to the fuel-box; yes, there was
fuel.</p>
<p>Now with his fingers he replenished the fire, and noiselessly
re-filled the kettle. Then he removed the clothes
and put the chair aside. The children still slept on. He
further investigated the resources of Scipio&#8217;s <i>m&eacute;nage</i>. He
found a wash-bowl and soap and a towel, three things he
rarely sought for any purposes of his own. Then, after
looking into the cupboard, he shook his head. It was deplorably
bare of all but uncleanliness. And it was the former
that caused his headshake, not the latter. With some
pride he re-stocked the shelves with the liberal purchases he
had made at Bill&#8217;s expense. He had provided everything
that a man&#8217;s mind could conceive as being necessary for the
interior of healthy childhood. True, he had made no provision
for a yellow pup.</p>
<p>By this time the kettle was boiling, and it served him as
a signal. In a harsh, untuneful voice he began to chant
an old coon-ditty. The effect of his music was instantaneous
as regards the more sensitive ears of the pup. Its
eyes opened, and it lifted its head alertly. Then, with a
quick wriggle, he sat up on his hind quarters, and, throwing
his lean, half-grown muzzle in the air, set up such a howl
of dismay that Sunny&#8217;s melody became entirely lost in a
jangle of discords. He caught up his empty sack and flung
it at the wailing pup&#8217;s head. It missed its aim, and in a
moment the twins had joined in their yellow friend&#8217;s lament.</p>
<p>Sunny never quite understood the real cause of that dismal
protest&ndash;&ndash;whether it was the sight of him, his doleful
singing, or the flinging of the sack. All he knew was that it
was very dreadful, and must be stopped as quickly as possible.
So, to that end, he began to cajole the children,
while he surreptitiously let fly a kick at the pup.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you bonny kids, you ain&#8217;t scairt o&#8217; poor Sunny
Oak,&#8221; he cried, while a streak of yellow flashed in the
sunlight and vanished through the door, a departure
which brought with it renewed efforts from the weeping
children. &#8220;It&#8217;s jest Sunny Oak wot nobody&#8217;ll let rest,&#8221;
he went on coaxingly. &#8220;He&#8217;s come along to feed you supper.
Say,&#8221; he cried, laboring hard for inspiration, &#8220;it&#8217;s
such a bully supper. Ther&#8217;s molasses, an&#8217; candy, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;
lob-ster!&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether it was the smacking of his lips as he dwelt on
the last word, or whether it was merely the fact that their
fright was passing, matters little; anyhow, the cries of the
twins died out as suddenly as they began, and their eyes,
big and round, gazed wonderingly up at Sunny&#8217;s unkempt
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s you, ugly man?&#8221; asked Vada at last, her brain
working more quickly than her brother&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ess&ndash;&ndash;ug&#8217;y man,&#8221; added Jamie unmeaningly.</p>
<p>Sunny&#8217;s hand went up to his face, and he scratched
amongst his sparse beard as though to test the accuracy of
the accusation. Then he grinned sheepishly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;m jest an ugly fairy that wants to be kind to
two lonesome kiddies,&#8221; he beamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;O&ndash;&ndash;oh! You&#8217;se a fairy?&#8221; said Vada doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ess,&#8221; nodded Jamie, thrilling with wonderment, and
eyeing him critically.</p>
<p>Elated with his success, Sunny went on warmly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep. Jest a fairy, an&#8217; I bro&#8217;t a heap o&#8217; good grub fer
you kiddies t&#8217; eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Vada&#8217;s small brain was following out its own train
of thought, and passed the food question by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Awful ugly,&#8221; she said, half to herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ess,&#8221; muttered Jamie abstractedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe,&#8221; said Sunny, with a laugh. &#8220;Wal, if you crawl
right out o&#8217; there an&#8217; git around, I got things fixed so we&#8217;ll
hev&#8217; a bully time.&#8221;</p>
<p>But his proposition hadn&#8217;t the effect he hoped. Instead
of moving, Jamie suddenly beat his head with his little
clenched fists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me wants yaller pup,&#8221; he cried, and forthwith howled
afresh.</p>
<p>Again Sunny realized his helplessness, and, glancing about
for further inspiration, caught sight of an inquiring yellow
head peering furtively in through the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, ther&#8217; he is,&#8221; he cried, vainly hoping to pacify the
child. Then he began at once a clumsy encouragement of
the dog. &#8220;Here, you yeller feller,&#8221; he cried, flicking his
fingers coaxingly. &#8220;Come along! Gee, you&#8217;re a pretty
feller. Hi! come along here.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the dog made no attempt to move, and Sunny began
to lose patience. &#8220;Come along, pups,&#8221; he cried, with
increasing force. &#8220;Come on, you miser&#8217;ble rat. Don&#8217;t
stan&#8217; ther&#8217; waggin&#8217; your fool tail like a whisk-broom. Say,
you yaller cur, I&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He started to fetch the creature,
but in a twinkling it had fled, to the accompaniment of a
fresh outburst from Jamie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tho&#8217;t you was a fairy,&#8221; protested Vada. &#8220;Fairies ken
do most anything. You&#8217;re jest an ugly ole man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny stood up and drew the back of his hand across his
perspiring forehead. He was worried. The fairy business
was played out, and he felt that he must begin again.
Children were by no means as easy to handle as he had
thought. He racked his brains, and suddenly bethought him
of another move.</p>
<p>In spite of Jamie&#8217;s whimpering, he went to the cupboard
and produced a tin of molasses. This he carefully opened
in full view of Vada&#8217;s questioning eyes. Jamie had also
become silent, watching him intently. He dug his finger
into the sticky contents and drew it out. Then he licked
his finger with tremendous enjoyment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully,&#8221; he muttered, apparently ignoring the children.</p>
<p>Instantly Vada was on her knees, crawling from under
the table, followed closely by her faithful shadow. She
came cautiously up to Sunny&#8217;s side and stood up.</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;lasses?&#8221; she inquired, and her eyes spoke volumes.</p>
<p>&#8220;O-oh!&#8221; muttered Jamie, scrambling to his feet beside
her holding up one fat hand.</p>
<p>Sunny, without replying, allowed them to dip their
fingers into the pot and taste the molasses. He felt that
the moment was critical, and he would not risk words
which might easily set them scuttling back to their stronghold.</p>
<p>His strategy was successful. Up came the hands again,
and he knew he had won their confidence. He allowed
them another dip into the pot, and then began the business
in hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll save the rest fer bimeby,&#8221; he said decidedly.
&#8220;Meanwhiles we&#8217;ll fix things right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wot things?&#8221; inquired Vada.</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;lasses,&#8221; said Jamie, with tearful eyes.</p>
<p>Again Sunny felt the crisis, but he carried the situation
with a firm hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bimeby, laddie,&#8221; he said cheerfully. &#8220;Meanwhiles we&#8217;ll
jest have a wash all round.&#8221;</p>
<p>And forthwith he set the wash-bowl ready and filled it
with warm water. Then, after some consideration and
trouble, having discovered a rag which had been used in the
household &#8220;wash-up,&#8221; and a piece of soap, he prepared to
start on little Vada. But she instantly protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;You first, Mister Fairy,&#8221; she said cheerfully. &#8220;My
poppa allus washes first. Then we has his water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ess,&#8221; agreed Jamie.</p>
<p>And, to his disgust, Sunny was forced to an unwilling
ablution, which, by strategy, he had hoped to escape. However,
the ordeal was manfully borne, and his reward was
quite worth his trouble. Vada promptly exclaimed when
she saw his face emerge from the dirty towel, shining with
grease off the house-flannel.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;se a fairy, sure,&#8221; she cried, clapping her hands and
dancing about gleefully. &#8220;On&#8217;y fairies can change theirselves.
You&#8217;se a pretty, pretty man&ndash;&ndash;now. Now, Jamie
dear. You next,&#8221; she added, with feminine assurance.
And with clumsy but willing enough hands Sunny Oak contrived
to cleanse his charges.</p>
<p>By the time his task was accomplished perfect good-will
reigned all round, and the climax was reached when the
yellow pup returned of its own accord, and was promptly
hugged to Jamie&#8217;s affectionate little bosom.</p>
<p>The next thing was to prepare the children&#8217;s supper.
This was a far more serious matter for the loafer. But he
finally achieved it, having learnt, by the process of cross-questioning
the girl, what was usual and therefore expected.
However, it was not without some difficulty that he succeeded
in providing an adequate meal, which consisted of
bread and milk, with bread and molasses as a sort of dessert.
For himself, he was forced to fare off a tin of lobster
and tea. Still, his difficulties were not of much consequence
so long as the children were satisfied. And any bother to
himself was his own fault, in having relied for a moment
on Sandy Joyce&#8217;s ideas of a menu.</p>
<p>Supper over and the table cleared, he decided on further
catechizing little Vada on points that still were a mystery
to him. So, with Jamie busy on the floor endeavoring to
solve the mystery of the pup&#8217;s wagging tail, he lit his pipe
and took Vada on his knee. He endeavored to recall
incidents of his own childhood; to remember something
of his own early routine. But somehow nothing was very
clear.</p>
<p>He had washed the children and given them food. Those
things seemed to him to be perfectly sound. Well, what
next? It was a little difficult. He glanced at the sun.
Surely bed would be quite in order. Bed&ndash;&ndash;ah, yes, that
was a happy thought. He remembered now, when he was
young he always used to get himself into trouble purposely
so they would send him to bed. But with this thought came
the regretful recollection that his predilection for bed was
quickly discovered, and his further penalties took the form
of the buckle end of his father&#8217;s waist-belt. However, he
put the proposition with much tact.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, kiddies,&#8221; he began, &#8220;how soon does your momma
put you to bed?&#8221;</p>
<p>Vada shook her wise little head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Momma don&#8217;t. Poppa does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when&#8217;s that?&#8221; he inquired, driving at his point
deliberately.</p>
<p>&#8220;When momma says.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vada was fastening and unfastening the man&#8217;s dirty
waistcoat with great interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; when does your momma say it?&#8221; Sunny persisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;When poppa&#8217;s done the chores.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>
<p>He felt himself on the wrong tack, and cast about for a
fresh line of argument.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you kiddies like bed some,&#8221; he hazarded doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me like m&#8217;lasses,&#8221; piped Jamie, who had managed to
get the pup&#8217;s tail over his shoulder, and was hanging on
to it with both hands. Vada shrieked as the pup began
to yelp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, look at Jamie,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;He&#8217;s pulling Dougal&#8217;s
tail right out. You&#8217;re a naughty, naughty boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not naughty,&#8221; protested Jamie, pulling harder.</p>
<p>Sunny reached down and released the mongrel, who
promptly turned round and licked the boy&#8217;s face. Jamie
fought him with his little clenched fists, and finally began
to cry.</p>
<p>Again Sunny went to the rescue, and with some difficulty
peace was restored. Then he went back to his subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess we&#8217;ll hev to go to bed right now,&#8221; he suggested,
with an air of authority.</p>
<p>&#8220;Momma ain&#8217;t back,&#8221; said Vada, her eyes round and
wondering.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be right along presently,&#8221; lied Sunny.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ess,&#8221; declared Jamie, &#8220;an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;we go find &#8217;piders
an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; bugs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vada nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lots an&#8217; lots.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s to-morrow,&#8221; said Sunny, taking his cue wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poppa ain&#8217;t back neither,&#8221; protested Vada.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone visitin&#8217;,&#8221; said Sunny. &#8220;Maybe he&#8217;ll be late.
Guess he&#8217;s havin&#8217; a hand at poker down at the store.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny was getting uncomfortably hot. Lies came easily
enough to him in the ordinary way, but with these poor
children it was somehow different.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poppa don&#8217;t play poker,&#8221; defended Vada. &#8220;On&#8217;y
wicked men does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ess,&#8221; agreed Jamie.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so.&#8221; Sunny felt himself on dangerous ground.</p>
<p>He smoked on thoughtfully for some moments. He felt
that a desperate move was required, and considered how best
to make it. Finally he resolved that he must assert his
authority. So, setting Vada on the ground, he stood up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bed,&#8221; he said, with a great assumption of finality.</p>
<p>Vada&#8217;s eyes rolled ominously, and a pucker came to her
little sunburnt brow. Jamie offered no preliminary, but
howled at once. And when, after the slightest hesitation,
Vada joined in his lament, Sunny&#8217;s distress became pitiable.
However, he managed to ease his feelings by several well-directed
mental curses at Wild Bill&#8217;s head, and all those
others concerned in reducing him to his present position.
And with this silently furious outburst there came a brain-wave
of great magnitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;First in bed sure gets most m&#8217;lasses,&#8221; he cried, darting
to the cupboard door and holding the well-smeared pot up
above his head.</p>
<p>The children&#8217;s cries ceased, and for a second they stood
staring up at him. Then, like a pair of rabbits, they turned
and ran for the bedroom, vanishing behind the curtain
amidst shrieking excitement. Sunny followed them with
the molasses and a handful of crackers.</p>
<p>They were both on the bed when he passed into the
room, huddling down under a couple of cotton blankets.
The man glanced round him. On the other side of the
room was the big bed where their father and mother
slept. Both beds were unmade, and the room was littered
with feminine garments in a manner that suggested the
mother&#8217;s hasty flight. Hardened as he was, the sight and
all it suggested depressed him. But he was not allowed
much time for reflection. Two childish voices shrieked at
him at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me first!&#8221; they cried in one breath.</p>
<p>And Sunny ladled them out molasses and crackers to their
hearts&#8217; content. When they had eaten all he thought good
for them Vada scrambled to her knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prayers,&#8221; she said, and clasped her hands before her
face.</p>
<p>Jamie wobbled up to her side and imitated her. And
Sunny stood by listening wonderingly to something that
brought back a world of recollection to him. It brought
him more. It laid before him a mental picture of his present
manhood which somehow nauseated him. But he stood
his ground till the final &#8220;Amens,&#8221; then he hustled the twins
almost roughly into the blankets, and, having extracted a
promise from them not to leave the bed again until he
returned, hurried out of the room.</p>
<p>He stood for a moment in the living-room. He was in
a doubt that almost confused him. Mechanically he looked
at the stove. The fire was quite safe. The window was
secure. Then he moved to the door. There was a lock to
it and a key. He passed out, and, locking the door behind
him, removed the key.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; he exclaimed, drinking in a breath of the evening
air, &#8220;five minutes more o&#8217; that an&#8217; I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; bin singin&#8217; funeral
hymns over my past life. Gee!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Ten minutes later he was in Wild Bill&#8217;s hut down at
the camp, and had finished his account of his adventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he finished up peevishly, &#8220;ther&#8217;s things a feller
can do, an&#8217; things he sure can&#8217;t. I tell you right here I ain&#8217;t
learned how to cluck to my chicks, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t never scratched
a worm in my life. I &#8217;low I&#8217;m too old to git busy that ways
now. If you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to raise them kids fer Zip while he&#8217;s
away, it&#8217;ll need a committee o&#8217; us fellers. It&#8217;s more&#8217;n one
feller&#8217;s job&ndash;&ndash;much more. It needs a wummin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill listened patiently until his deputy had aired his final
grievance. His fierce eyes had in them a peculiar twinkle
that was quite lost on Sunny in his present mood. However,
when the injured man had finished his tale of woe the
gambler stretched his long legs out, and lolled back in his
chair with a fresh chew of tobacco in his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t done too bad,&#8221; he said judicially. &#8220;That
m&#8217;lasses racket was a heap smart. Though&ndash;&ndash;say, you&#8217;ll get
around ther&#8217; come sun-up to-morrer, an&#8217; you&#8217;ll fix &#8217;em right
all day. Maybe Zip&#8217;ll be back later. Anyways, you&#8217;ll fix
&#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not on your life&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; began Sunny, in fierce rebellion.
But Bill cut him short.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do it, Sunny,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;an&#8217; don&#8217;t you make no
mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s manner was irresistibly threatening, and Sunny
was beaten back into moody silence. But if looks could
have killed, Bill&#8217;s chances of life were small indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;re off duty now,&#8221; the gambler went on icily.
&#8220;You&#8217;re off duty till&ndash;&ndash;sun-up. You&#8217;re free to get drunk,
or&ndash;&ndash;what in hell you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny rose from his seat. His rebellious eyes were
fiercely alight as he regarded his master.</p>
<p>&#8220;May your soul rot!&#8221; he cried venomously. And with
this final impotent explosion he slouched out of the hut.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dessay it will,&#8221; Bill called after him amiably. &#8220;But
it ain&#8217;t started yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>But his jibe was quite lost on the angry Sunny, for he
had left him with the haste of a man driven to fear of
whither his anger might carry him.</p>
<p>Left alone, Wild Bill chuckled. He liked Sunny, but
despised his mode of life with all the arrogant superiority of
a man of great force, even if of indifferent morals. He
had no patience with a weakened manhood. With him it
was only strength that counted. Morality was only for
those who had not the courage to face a mysterious future
unflinchingly. The future concerned him not at all. He
had no fears of anybody or anything, either human or superhuman.
Death offered him no more terrors than Life.
And whichever was his portion he was ready to accept it
unquestioningly, unprotestingly.</p>
<p>He allowed the hoboe time to get well clear of his shack.
Then he stood up and began to pace the room thoughtfully.
A desperate frown depressed his brows until they met over
the bridge of his large thin nose. Something was working
swiftly, even passionately, in his brain, and it was evident
that his thoughts were more than unpleasant to himself. As
the moments passed his strides became more aggressive,
and his movements were accompanied by gesticulations of a
threatening nature with his clenched fists.</p>
<p>At last he paused in his walk, and dropped again into his
chair. Here he sat for a long while. Then, of a sudden,
he lifted his head and glanced swiftly about his bare room.
Finally he sprang to his feet and crushed his slouch hat
on his head, and, crossing over to the oil-lamp on the
table, blew it out. Then he passed out into the night,
slamming and locking the door behind him.</p>
<p>The night was dark, and the moon would not rise for at
least another hour. The air was still laden with the heat of
the long summer&#8217;s day, and it hummed with the music of
stirring insect life. He strode along the trail past the store.
He glanced at the lighted windows longingly, for he had
an appointment for a game in there that night. But he
passed on.</p>
<p>As he came to the camp dumps he paused for a moment
to take his bearings. Then he continued his way with long,
decided strides, and in a few minutes the dim outline of
Scipio&#8217;s house loomed up before him. He came close up,
and walked slowly round it. At one window he paused,
listening. There was not a sound to be heard outside. At
the window of the bedroom he listened a long time. No, he
could not even hear the children breathing.</p>
<p>At last he reached the door which Sunny had locked. He
cautiously tried the handle, and the sound brought a whimper
from the yellow pup within. He cursed the animal
softly under his breath and waited, hoping the wretched
creature would settle down again. He heard it snuff at the
foot of the door, and then the soft patter of its feet died
away, and he knew that the poor thing had satisfied itself
that all was well.</p>
<p>He smiled, and sat down at the foot of the door. And,
with his knees drawn up into his arms, he prepared for his
long vigil. It was the posting of the night sentry over
Scipio&#8217;s twins.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>WILD BILL THINKS HARD&ndash;&ndash;AND HEARS NEWS</h3>
</div>
<p>Wild Bill stretched himself drowsily. It was noon. He
knew that by the position of the patch of sunlight on the
floor, which he gazed at with blinking eyes. Presently he
reached out his long arms and clasped his hands behind his
head. He lay there on his stretcher bed, still very sleepy,
but with wakefulness gaining ascendancy rapidly. He had
completed two successive nights of &#8220;sentry-go&#8221; over Scipio&#8217;s
twins, never reaching his blankets until well after sun-up.</p>
<p>For some minutes he enjoyed the delicious idleness of a
still brain. Then, at last, it stirred to an activity which
once again set flowing all the busy thought of his long
night&#8217;s vigil. Further rest became impossible to a man of
his temperament, and he sprang from his blankets and
plunged his face into a bucket of fresh water which stood
on an adjacent bench. In five minutes he was ready for the
business of the day.</p>
<p>It was to be a day of activity. He felt that. Yet he had
made no definite plans. Only all his thoughts of the
previous night warned him that something must be done,
and that it was &#8220;up to him to get busy.&#8221;</p>
<p>A long wakeful night is apt to distort many things of
paramount interest. But the morning light generally reduces
them to their proper focus. Thus it is with people
who are considered temperamental. But Bill had no such
claims. He was hard, unimaginative, and of keen decision.
And overnight he had arrived at one considerable decision.
How he had arrived at it he hardly knew. Perhaps it was
one of those decisions that cannot be helped. Certain it
was that it had been arrived at through no definite course of
reasoning. It had simply occurred to him and received his
approval at once. An approval, which, once given, was
rarely, if ever, rescinded. This was the man.</p>
<p>He had first thought a great deal about Scipio. He felt
that the time had come when his fate must be closely
inquired into. The blundering efforts of Sunny Oak were
so hopelessly inadequate in the care of the children, that
only the return of their father could save them from some
dire domestic catastrophe.</p>
<p>Sunny apparently meant well by them. But Bill hated
well-meaning people who disguised their incompetence under
the excellence of their intentions. Besides, in this case
it was so useless. These two children were a nuisance, he
admitted, but they must not be allowed to suffer through
Sunny&#8217;s incompetence. No, their father must be found.</p>
<p>Then there was his mare, Gipsy; and when he thought of
her he went hot with an alarm which no threat to himself
could have inspired. This turn of thought brought James
into his focus. That personage was rarely far from it, and
he needed very little prompting to bring the outlaw into the
full glare of his mental limelight. He hated James. He
had seen him rarely, and spoken to him perhaps only a
dozen times, when he first appeared on Suffering Creek.
But he hated him as though he were his most bitter personal
enemy.</p>
<p>He had no reason to offer for this hatred, beyond the
outlaw&#8217;s known depredations and the constant threat of his
presence in the district. At least no reason he would have
admitted publicly. But then Wild Bill was not a man to
bother with reasons much at any time. And it was the
venomous hatred of the man which now drove him to a
decision of the first importance. And such was his satisfaction
in the interest of his decision, that, for the time being,
at least, poker was robbed of its charm, faro had become a
game of no consequence whatever, and gambling generally,
with all its subtleties as he understood them, was no longer
worth while. He had decided upon a game with a higher
stake than any United States currency could afford. It was
a game of life and death. James, &#8220;Lord&#8221; James, as he
contemptuously declared, must go. There was no room for
him in the same district as Wild Bill of Abilene.</p>
<p>It would be useless to seek the method by which this
decision was reached. In a man such as Bill the subtleties
of his motives were far too involved and deeply hidden.
The only possible chance of estimating the truth would be
to question his associates as to their opinion. And even
then such opinions would be biased by personal understanding
of the man, and so would be of but small account.</p>
<p>Thus Minky would probably have declared that his decision
was the result of his desire for the welfare of the community
in which he claimed his best friends. Sandy Joyce
would likely have shaken his head, and declared it
was the possibility of something having happened to his
mare Gipsy. Toby Jenks might have had a wild idea
that Bill had made his &#8220;pile&#8221; on the &#8220;crook&#8221; and was
&#8220;gettin&#8217; religion.&#8221; Sunny Oak, whose shrewd mind spent
most of its time in studying the peculiarities of his fellows,
might have whispered an opinion to himself, when no one
was about, to the effect that Bill couldn&#8217;t stand for a rival
&#8220;boss&#8221; around Suffering Creek.</p>
<p>Any of these opinions might have been right, just as any
of them might have been very wide of the mark. Anyhow,
certain it is that no citizen of Suffering Creek would, even
when thoroughly drunk, have accused Bill of any leaning
towards sentimentalism or chivalry. The idea that he cared
two cents for what became of Scipio, or his wife, or his
children, it would have been impossible to have driven into
their heads with a sledge-hammer. And maybe they would
have been right. Who could tell?</p>
<p>His decision was taken without any definite argument,
without any heroics. He frankly declared to himself that
James must go. And having decided, he, equally frankly,
declared that &#8220;the proposition was up to him.&#8221; This was
his silent ultimatum, and, having delivered it, there was no
turning back. He would carry it out with as little mercy
to himself as he would show to any other concerned.</p>
<p>The men of Suffering Creek thought they knew this man.
But it is doubtful if anybody, even the man himself, knew
Wild Bill. Probably the nearest approach to a fair estimate
of him would have been to describe him as a sort of driving
force to a keen brain and hot, passionate heart. Whether
he possessed any of the gentler human feelings only his acts
could show, for so hard and unyielding was his manner, so
ruthless his purpose when his mind was made up, that it
left little room for the ordinary observer to pack in a belief
of the softer side to the man.</p>
<p>Ten minutes after performing his primitive ablutions
Wild Bill was eating breakfast in the dining-room at the
store, with Minky sitting opposite to him. The storekeeper
was telling him of something that happened the night before,
with a troubled expression in his honest eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was wonderin&#8217; when you&#8217;d get around,&#8221; he said, as
soon as Birdie Mason had withdrawn to the kitchen. &#8220;I&#8217;d
have given a deal for you to have been playin&#8217; last night. I
would sure. There was three fellers, strangers, lookin&#8217; for
a hand at poker. They&#8217;d got a fine wad o&#8217; money, too, and
were ready for a tall game. They got one with Irish
O&#8217;Brien, an&#8217; Slade o&#8217; Kentucky, but they ain&#8217;t fliers, an&#8217;
the strangers hit &#8217;em good an&#8217; plenty. Guess they must
ha&#8217; took five hundred dollars out of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill&#8217;s sharp eyes were suddenly lifted from his plate. He
was eating noisily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you locate &#8217;em&ndash;&ndash;the strangers?&#8221; he grated.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s sure the pinch,&#8221; said Minky, wiping his broad
forehead with a colored handkerchief. The heat in the dining-room
was oppressive. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never see &#8217;em before, an&#8217;
they didn&#8217;t seem like talkin&#8217; a heap. They were all three
hard-lookin&#8217; citizens, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;might ha&#8217; been anything from
bum cowpunchers to&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sharps,&#8221; put in Bill, between noisy sips at his coffee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minky watched a number of flies settle on a greasy patch
on the bare table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Y&#8217;see,&#8221; he went on, after a thoughtful pause, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
like strangers who don&#8217;t seem ready tongued&ndash;&ndash;none of us
do, since the stage-robbin&#8217; set in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Bill set his cup down.</p>
<p>Minky nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ain&#8217;t sent out a parcel of gold for months, an&#8217; I&#8217;m
kind o&#8217; full up with dust about now. Y&#8217;see, the boys has
got to cash their stuff, and I&#8217;m here to make trade, so&ndash;&ndash;wal,
I jest got to fill myself with gold-dust, an&#8217; take my chances.
I&#8217;m mighty full just now&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; strangers worry me some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re weakenin&#8217;,&#8221; said Bill sharply, but his eyes were
serious, and suggested a deep train of swift thought.
Presently he reached a piece of bread and spread molasses
on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;re figgerin&#8217; it &#8217;ud be safer to empty out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minky nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;And these strangers?&#8221; Bill went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve lit out,&#8221; said Minky ruefully. &#8220;I ast a few
questions of the boys. They rode out at sun-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did they sleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know. Nobody seems to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minky sighed audibly. And Bill went on eating.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t heerd nothing o&#8217; Zip?&#8221; the storekeeper inquired
presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout that mare o&#8217; yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill&#8217;s face suddenly flushed, and his fierce brows drew
together in an ominous frown, but he made no answer.
Minky saw the change and edged off.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time he was gettin&#8217; around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was kind of wonderin&#8217;,&#8221; Minky went on thoughtfully,
&#8220;if he don&#8217;t turn up&ndash;&ndash;wot&#8217;s to happen with them
kids?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t figgered.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill&#8217;s interest was apparently wandering.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll need to be gettin&#8217; around or&ndash;&ndash;somethin&#8217;s got to
be done,&#8221; Minky drifted on vaguely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y&#8217;see, Sunny&#8217;s jest a hoboe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t guess Zip&#8217;s claim amounts to pea-shucks neither,&#8221;
the storekeeper went on, his mind leaning towards the
financial side of the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Them kids&#8217;ll cost money, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill nodded, but no one could have detected any interest
in his movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d it be to get that claim worked for him&ndash;&ndash;while
he&#8217;s away?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe Zip&#8217;ll be gettin&#8217; back,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; if he don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was interest enough in Bill now. His interrogation
was full of suppressed force.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. James.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill sprang to his feet and kicked back his chair. The
sudden rage in his eyes was startling, even to Minky, who
was used to the man. However, he waited, and in a
moment or two his friend was talking again in his usually
cold tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll jest git around an&#8217; see how Sunny&#8217;s doin&#8217;,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Then he drew out a pipe and began to cut flakes of
tobacco from a black plug.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Minky,&#8221; he went on, after a moment&#8217;s pause.
&#8220;You need to do some thinkin&#8217;. How much dust have you
got in the store?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout twenty thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; Bill whistled softly as he packed the tobacco
in his pipe. &#8220;An elegant parcel for strangers to handle.&#8221;</p>
<p>The storekeeper&#8217;s face became further troubled.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sure is&ndash;&ndash;if they handle it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill&#8217;s pipe was alight now, and he puffed at it vigorously,
speaking between the puffs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Y&#8217;see, this feller James plays a big game. Cattle duffin&#8217;
and ord&#8217;n&#8217;ry stage-robbin&#8217; ain&#8217;t good enough, nor big enough,
to run his gang on. He needs gold stages, and we ain&#8217;t
sendin&#8217; gold stages out. Wal, wot&#8217;s the conclusion? I ast
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll hev to light out, or&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest so. Or he&#8217;ll get around here to&ndash;&ndash;look into things.
Those strangers last night were mebbe &#8216;lookin&#8217; into things.&#8217;
You&#8217;ll need to stow that dust where the rats can&#8217;t gnaw it.
Later we&#8217;ll think things out. Meanwhile there&#8217;s one thing
sure, we don&#8217;t need strangers on Suffering Creek. There&#8217;s
enough o&#8217; the boys around to work the gold, an&#8217; when they
get it they mostly know what to do with it. Guess I&#8217;ll get
on up to Zip&#8217;s shack.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men walked out into the store. Minky in a
pessimistic mood passed in behind his counter. This question
of gold had bothered him for some weeks. Since the
first stage-robbing, and James&#8217; name had become a &#8220;terror&#8221;
in the district, he had opened a sort of banking business for
the prospectors. Commercially it appealed to him enormously.
The profits under his primitive methods of dealing
with the matter were dazzlingly large, and, in consequence,
the business became a dominant portion of his trade. Nor
was it until the quantity of gold he bought began to grow,
and mount into thousands of dollars&#8217; worth, that the difficulties
of his traffic began to force themselves upon him. Then
it was that he realized that if it was insecure to dispatch a
gold stage laden with the property of the prospectors, how
was he to be able to hold his stock at the store with any
greater degree of security.</p>
<p>The more he thought of the matter the greater the difficulties
appeared. Of course he saw possibilities, but none of
them offered the security he needed. Then worry set in.
History might easily repeat itself on Suffering Creek.
James&#8217; gang was reported to be a large one. Well, what if
he chose to sweep down upon the camp, and clean the place
out. Herein lay the trouble. And in consequence his days
and nights were none too easy.</p>
<p>He had never spoken of the matter before. It was not
a subject to be discussed with anybody. But Bill was
different from the rest, and, for several days, Minky had
sought an opportunity of unburdening himself to his friend.
Now, at last, he had done so, and, in return, had received
small enough comfort. Still he felt he had done the best
thing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE FORERUNNER OF THE TRUST</h3>
</div>
<p>Bill passed straight through the store and set out across
the town dumps. And it would have been impossible to
guess how far he was affected by Minky&#8217;s plaint. His face
might have been a stone wall for all expression it had of
what was passing behind it. His cold eyes were fixed upon
the hut ahead of him without apparent interest or meaning.
His thoughts were his own at all times.</p>
<p>As he drew near he heard Sunny&#8217;s voice raised in song,
and he listened intently, wondering the while if the loafer
had any idea of its quality. It was harsh, nasal and possessed
as much tune as a freshly sharpened &#8220;buzz-saw.&#8221;
But his words were distinct. Far too distinct Bill thought
with some irritation.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>

</td></tr></table>
<p>Just as Sunny was about to begin the next verse Bill
appeared in the doorway, and the vocalist was reduced to a
pained silence by his harsh criticism.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d orter be rootin&#8217; kebbeges on a hog ranch wi&#8217; that
voice,&#8221; he said icily. &#8220;You&#8217;re sure the worst singer in
America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he glanced round for the children. They were
nowhere to be seen. Sunny was at the cookstove boiling
milk in a tin &#8220;billy.&#8221; His face was greasy with perspiration,
and, even to Bill&#8217;s accustomed eyes, he looked dirtier
than ever. He stood now with a spoon poised, just as he
had lifted it out of the pot at the moment of the other&#8217;s
entrance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the kids?&#8221; the latter demanded sharply.</p>
<p>Sunny shifted his feet a little uneasily and glanced round
the dirty room. The place looked as though it hadn&#8217;t been
cleaned for a month. There was a hideous accumulation
of unwashed utensils scattered everywhere. The floor was
unswept, let alone unwashed. And the smell of stale food
and general mustiness helped to add to the keenness of the
visitor&#8217;s nervous edge as he waited for the man&#8217;s reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess they&#8217;re out on the dumps playin&#8217; at findin&#8217; gold,&#8221;
Sunny said, with a slightly forced laugh. &#8220;Y&#8217;see, little
Vada&#8217;s staked out a claim on a patch of elegant garbage, an&#8217;
is digging fer worms. Them&#8217;s the gold. An&#8217; Jamie&#8217;s
playin&#8217; &#8216;bad man&#8217; an&#8217; swoopin&#8217; down on her and sneakin&#8217;
her worms. It&#8217;s a new game. Y&#8217;see, I thought it out and
taught &#8217;em how to play it. They&#8217;re a heap struck on it,
too. I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But words somehow failed him under the baleful stare of
the other&#8217;s eyes. And turning back to the milk he fell into
a stupid silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get right out an&#8217; huyk them kiddies off&#8217;n those
dumps,&#8221; cried Bill sharply. &#8220;You got no more sense in
your idjot head than to slep when your eyes shut. Diggin&#8217;
worms on the dumps! Gee! Say, if it ain&#8217;t enough to
give &#8217;em bile and measles, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; spots, then I don&#8217;t know
a &#8216;deuce-spot&#8217; from a hay-rake. Git right out, you loafin&#8217;
bum, an&#8217; fetch &#8217;em in, an&#8217; then get the muck off&#8217;n your face,
an&#8217; clean this doggone shack up. I&#8217;d sure say you was a
travelin&#8217; hospital o&#8217; disease by the look of you. I&#8217;m payin&#8217;
you a wage and a heap good one, so git out&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I&#8217;ll see to
that darn milk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Argument was out of the question, so Sunny adopted the
easier course of obedience to his employer&#8217;s orders. He
dropped the spoon into the milk with a suddenness that
suggested resentment, and shuffled out, muttering. But Bill
followed him to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; he inquired threateningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say nothin&#8217;,&#8221; lied Sunny.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t jest guess you did,&#8221; retorted Bill sarcastically.
And he watched his man hurry out into the sunlight with
eyes that had somehow become less severe.</p>
<p>He waited where he was for some moments. Then he
turned back into the room and stared disgustedly about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a feller can&#8217;t fix two kiddies right an&#8217; cook &#8217;em pap
without mussin&#8217; things till you feel like dying o&#8217; colic at the
sight, he ain&#8217;t fit to rob hogs of rootin&#8217; space,&#8221; he muttered.
&#8220;I&#8217;d&ndash;&ndash;Gee-whiz! Ther&#8217;s that doggone milk raising blue
murder wi&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He rushed to the stove where the boiling milk was pouring
over the sides of the pot in a hissing, bubbling stream. He
clutched at the &#8220;billy,&#8221; scalding his fingers badly, jerked it
off the stove, upset the contents on the floor and flung the
pot itself across the room, where it fell with a clatter upon
a pile of dirty tin plates and pannikins. He swore violently
and sucked his injured fingers, while, in angry dismay, he
contemplated the additional mess his carelessness had caused.
And at that moment Sunny returned, leading two grubby-faced
infants by the hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got &#8217;em back,&#8221; he cried cheerfully. Then his shrewd
eyes took in the situation at a glance, and they sparkled with
malicious glee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee,&#8221; he cried, releasing the youngsters and pointing at
the mess on the stove and floor. &#8220;Now ain&#8217;t that a real
pity? Say, how d&#8217;you come to do that? It sure ain&#8217;t a
heap of trouble heatin&#8217; a drop o&#8217; milk. Most any fule ken
do that. I tho&#8217;t you savvied that, I sure did, or I&#8217;d ha&#8217; put
you wise. Y&#8217;see, you should jest let it ha&#8217; come to the bile,
an&#8217; then whip it off quick. My, but it&#8217;s real foolish! Ten
cents o&#8217; milk wasted for want of a little sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our dinner milk,&#8221; cried Vada in consternation. &#8220;All
gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All dorn,&#8221; echoed Jamie, flinging himself on the floor
and dipping his fingers into the mess and licking them with
grave appreciation.</p>
<p>In a moment he was joined by the inevitable yellow pup,
which burnt its tongue and set up a howl. Vada ran to the
animal&#8217;s assistance, fell over Jamie&#8217;s sprawling legs and
rolled heavily in the mess.</p>
<p>For some seconds confusion reigned. Sunny darted to
Vada&#8217;s rescue, sent the pup flying with a well-directed kick,
picked the weeping girl up, and tried to shake some of the
milk from her dirty clothing. While Bill grabbed Jamie out
of the way of any further mischief. The boy struggled
furiously to free himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me want dinner milk,&#8221; he shouted, and beat the
gambler&#8217;s chest with both his little fists.</p>
<p>&#8220;You kicked Dougal!&#8221; wailed Vada, from under Sunny&#8217;s
arm.</p>
<p>And at that moment a mild voice reached them from the
open doorway&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s happenin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill and Sunny turned at once. And the next instant the
children were shrieking in quite a different tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pop-pa,&#8221; they shouted, with all the power of their
childish lungs. The men released them, and, with a rush,
they hurled themselves upon the small person of their father.</p>
<p>Scipio set a bundle he was carrying upon the floor and
scrambled Jamie into his arms and kissed him. Then he
kissed Vada. After that he stood up, and, in a peculiarly
dazed fashion gazed about him, out of a pair of blackened
and bloodshot eyes, while the children continued to cling
to him.</p>
<p>The two onlookers never took their eyes off him. Sunny
Oak gazed with unfeigned astonishment and alarm, but Bill
merely stared. The little man was a pitiable object. His
clothes were tattered. His face was bruised and cut, and
dry blood was smeared all round his mouth. Both eyes
were black, and in one of them the white was changed to a
bright scarlet.</p>
<p>James&#8217; men had done their work all too well. They had
handled their victim with the brutality of the savages they
were.</p>
<p>Scipio let his eyes rest on Bill, and, after a moment&#8217;s
hesitation, as though gathering together his still scattered
wits, spoke his gratitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was real kind of you lendin&#8217; me Gipsy. I set her
back in the barn. She&#8217;s come to no harm. She ain&#8217;t got
saddle-sore, nor&ndash;&ndash;nor nothin&#8217;. Maybe she&#8217;s a bit tuckered,
but she&#8217;s none the worse, sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill clicked his tongue, but made no other response. At
that moment it would have been impossible for him to have
expressed the thoughts passing through his fierce mind.
Sunny, however, was more superficial. Words were bursting
from his lips. And when he spoke his first remark was
a hopeless inanity.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got back?&#8221; he questioned.</p>
<p>Scipio&#8217;s poor face worked into the ghost of a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said. And the awkwardness of the meeting
drove him to silently caressing his children.</p>
<p>Presently Sunny, who was not delicate-minded, pointed
at his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you had a fall?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, I found him and&ndash;&ndash;his boys got rough,&#8221; he
explained simply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no mistaking Sunny&#8217;s anger. He forgot his
usual lazy indifference. For once he was stirred to a rage
that was as active and volcanic as one of Wild Bill&#8217;s sudden
passions.</p>
<p>But the gambler at last found his tongue, and Sunny was
given no further opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you got there?&#8221; he asked, pointing at the parcel
Scipio had deposited on the floor.</p>
<p>The little man glanced down at it.</p>
<p>&#8220;That?&#8221; he said hazily. &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s bacon an&#8217; things.
I got &#8217;em from Minky on my way up. He told me you&#8217;d
sure got grub up here, an&#8217; I didn&#8217;t need to get things. But
I guessed I couldn&#8217;t let you do all this now I&#8217;m back. Say,&#8221;
he added, becoming more alert. &#8220;I want to thank you both,
you bin real good helping me out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill swallowed some tobacco juice, and coughed violently.
Sunny was eaten up with a rage he could scarcely restrain.
But Scipio turned to the children, who were now clinging
silently to his moleskin trousers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess we&#8217;ll get busy an&#8217; fix things up,&#8221; he said, laying
caressing hands upon them. &#8220;You&#8217;ll need your dinners,
sure. Poppa&#8217;s got nice bacon. How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully,&#8221; cried Vada promptly. Now that she had her
father again everything was &#8220;bully.&#8221; But Jamie was
silently staring up at the man&#8217;s distorted features. He
didn&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>Wild Bill recovered from his coughing, suddenly bestirred
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess we&#8217;d best git goin&#8217;, Sunny,&#8221; he said quietly.
&#8220;Zip&#8217;ll likely need to fix things up some. Y&#8217;see, Zip,&#8221; he
went on, turning to the father, &#8220;Sunny&#8217;s done his best to
kep things goin&#8217; right. He&#8217;s fed the kiddies, which was the
most ne&#8217;ssary thing. As for keppin&#8217; the place clean,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he
pointed at the small sea of milk which still stood in pools
on the floor&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I don&#8217;t guess he&#8217;s much when it comes to
cleanin&#8217; anything&ndash;&ndash;not even hisself. I &#8217;low he&#8217;s wrecked
things some. Ther&#8217;s a heap of milk wasted. Howsum&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; cried the outraged Sunny. But Bill would allow
no interruption.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll git goin&#8217;,&#8221; he said, with biting coldness. &#8220;Come
right along. So long, Zip,&#8221; he added, with an unusual touch
of gentleness. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be along to see you later. We need
to talk some.&#8221;</p>
<p>He moved over to Sunny&#8217;s side, and his hand closed upon
his arm. And somehow his grip kept the loafer silent until
they passed out of the hut. Once outside the gambler threw
his shoulders back and breathed freely. But he offered no
word. Only Sunny was inclined to talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, he&#8217;s had a desprit bad time,&#8221; he said, with eyes
ablaze.</p>
<p>But Bill still remained silent. Nor did another word pass
between them until they reached Minky&#8217;s store.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The moment they had departed Scipio glanced forlornly
round his home. It was a terrible home-coming. Three
days ago in spite of all set-backs and shortcomings, hope had
run high in his heart. Now&ndash;&ndash;He left the twins standing
and walked to the bedroom door. He looked in. But the
curtains dropped from his nerveless fingers and he turned
back to the living room, sick in mind and heart. For one
moment his eyes stared unmeaningly at the children. Then
he sat down on the chair nearest the table and beckoned
them over to him. They came, thrilled with awe in their
small wondering minds. Their father&#8217;s distorted features
fascinated yet horrified them.</p>
<p>Jamie scrambled to one knee and Vada hugged one of
the little man&#8217;s arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to have dinner, kiddies,&#8221; he said, with
attempted lightness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ess,&#8221; said Jamie absently. Then he reached up to the
wound on his father&#8217;s right cheek, and touched it gently
with one small finger. It was so sore that the man flinched,
and the child&#8217;s hand was withdrawn instantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oose&#8217;s hurted,&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pore poppa&#8217;s all hurt up,&#8221; added Vada tearfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not hurt proper,&#8221; said Scipio, with a wan smile.
&#8220;Y&#8217;see, it was jest a game, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; the boys were rough.
Now we&#8217;ll git dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Vada&#8217;s mind was running on with swift childish
curiosity, and she put a sudden question.</p>
<p>&#8220;When&#8217;s momma comin&#8217; back?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s eyes shifted to the open doorway. The golden
sunlight beyond was shining with all the splendor of a
summer noon. But for all his blackened eyes saw there
might have been a gray fog of winter outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Momma?&#8221; he echoed blankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ess, momma,&#8221; cried Jamie. &#8220;When she comin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio shook his head and sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;When she comin&#8217;?&#8221; insisted Vada.</p>
<p>The man lowered his eyes till they focused themselves
upon the yellow pup, now hungrily licking up the cold milk.</p>
<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t come back,&#8221; he said at last, in a low voice.
Then with a despairing gesture, he added: &#8220;Never! never!&#8221;
And his head dropped upon Jamie&#8217;s little shoulder while he
hugged Vada more closely to his side as though he feared
to lose her too.</p>

<h3>THE TRUST</h3>
</div>
<p>It was a blazing afternoon of the &#8220;stewing&#8221; type. The
flies in the store kept up a sickening hum, and tortured
suffering humanity&ndash;&ndash;in the form of the solitary Minky&ndash;&ndash;with
their persistent efforts to alight on his perspiring face
and bare arms. The storekeeper, with excellent forethought,
had showered sticky papers, spread with molasses
and mucilage, broadcast about the shelves, to ensnare the unwary
pests. But though hundreds were lured to their death
by sirupy drowning, the attacking host remained undiminished,
and the death-traps only succeeded in adding disgusting
odors to the already laden atmosphere. Fortunately,
noses on Suffering Creek were not over-sensitive, and the
fly, with all his native unpleasantness, was a small matter in
the scheme of the frontiersman&#8217;s life, and, like all other obstructions,
was brushed aside physically as well as mentally.</p>
<p>The afternoon quiet had set in. The noon rush had
passed, nor would the re-awakening of the camp occur until
evening. Ordinarily the quiet of the long afternoon would
have been pleasant enough to the hard-working storekeeper.
For surely there is something approaching delight in the
leisure moments of a day&#8217;s hard and prosperous work. But
just now Minky had little ease of mind. And these long
hours, when the camp was practically deserted, had become
a sort of nightmare to him. The gold-dust stored in the dim
recesses of his cellars haunted him. The outlaw, James, was
a constant dread. For he felt that his store held a bait
which might well be irresistible to that individual. Experienced
as he was in the ways of frontier life, the advent of
the strangers of the night before had started a train of alarm
which threatened quickly to grow into panic.</p>
<p>He was pondering this matter when Sunny Oak, accompanied
by the careless Toby Jenks, lounged into the store.
With a quick, almost furtive eye the storekeeper glanced
up to ascertain the identity of the newcomers. And, when
he recognized them, such was the hold his alarm had upon
him, that his first thought was as to their fitness to help in
case of his own emergency. But his fleeting hope received
a prompt negative. Sunny was useless, he decided. And
Toby&ndash;&ndash;well, Toby was so far an unknown quantity in all
things except his power of spending on drink the money
he had never earned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t out on your claim?&#8221; he greeted the remittance
man casually.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too blamed hot,&#8221; Toby retorted, winking heavily.</p>
<p>Then he mopped his face and ordered two whiskies.</p>
<p>&#8220;That stuff won&#8217;t cool you down any,&#8221; observed Minky,
passing behind his counter.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Toby admitted doubtfully. Then with a bright
look of intelligence. &#8220;But it&#8217;ll buck a feller so it don&#8217;t
seem so bad&ndash;&ndash;the heat, I mean.&#8221; His afterthought set
Sunny grinning.</p>
<p>Minky set out two glasses and passed the bottle. The
men helped themselves, and with a simultaneous &#8220;How!&#8221;
gulped their drinks down thirstily.</p>
<p>Minky re-corked the bottle and wiped a few drops of
water from the counter.</p>
<p>&#8220;So Zip&#8217;s around,&#8221; he said, as the glasses were returned
to the counter. And instantly Sunny&#8217;s face became unusually
serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he cried, with a hard look in his good-natured
eyes. &#8220;D&#8217;you ever feel real mad about things? So mad,
I mean, you want to get right out an&#8217; hurt somebody or
somethin&#8217;? So mad, folks is likely to git busy an&#8217; string
you up with a rawhide? I&#8217;m sure mostly dead easy as a
man, but I feel that away jest about now. I&#8217;ve sed to myself
I&#8217;d do best settin&#8217; my head in your wash-trough. I&#8217;ve
said it more&#8217;n oncet in the last half-hour. But I don&#8217;t guess
it&#8217;s any sort o&#8217; use. So&ndash;&ndash;so, I&#8217;ll cut out the wash-trough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You most generally do,&#8221; said Toby pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t comic&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;cep&#8217; when you&#8217;re feedin&#8217;,&#8221; retorted
Sunny, nettled. Then he turned to Minky, just as the
doorway of the store was darkened by the advent of Sandy
Joyce. But he glanced back in the newcomer&#8217;s direction
and nodded. Then he went on immediately with his talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, have you seen him?&#8221; he demanded of anybody.
&#8220;I&#8217;m talkin&#8217; o&#8217; Zip,&#8221; he added, for Sandy&#8217;s enlightenment.
&#8220;He found James. Located his ranch, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; nigh got
hammered to death for his pains. Gee!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We see him,&#8221; said Minky, after an awed pause. &#8220;But
he never said a word. He jest set Bill&#8217;s mare back in the
barn, an&#8217; bo&#8217;t bacon, and hit off to hum.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see him,&#8221; Sandy admitted. &#8220;How was he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Battered nigh to death, I said,&#8221; cried Sunny, with
startling violence. &#8220;His eyes are blackened, an&#8217; his pore
mean face is cut about, an&#8217; bruised ter&#8217;ble. His clothes is
torn nigh to rags, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it the James outfit did it?&#8221; inquired Minky
incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;They did that surely,&#8221; cried Sunny vehemently. &#8220;You
ain&#8217;t seen Bill, have you? He&#8217;s that mad you can&#8217;t git a
word out o&#8217; him. I tell you right here somethin&#8217;s goin&#8217; to
happen. Somethin&#8217;s got to happen,&#8221; he added, with a fresh
burst of rage. &#8220;That gang needs cleanin&#8217; out. They need
shootin&#8217; up like vermin, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re goin&#8217; to do it?&#8221; inquired Sandy sarcastically.</p>
<p>Sunny turned on him in a flash.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take my share in it,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;an&#8217; it&#8217;ll need to
be a big share to satisfy me,&#8221; he added, with such evident
sincerity and fiery determination that his companions stared
at him in wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess Sunny&#8217;s had his rest broke,&#8221; observed Toby, with
a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have that sure. An&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; it makes me mad to git
busy,&#8221; the loafer declared. &#8220;Have you seen that pore feller
with his face all mussed? Gee! Say, Zip wouldn&#8217;t hurt a
louse; he&#8217;s that gentle-natured I&#8217;d say if ther&#8217; was only a
baulky mule between him an&#8217; starvation he&#8217;d hate to live.
He ain&#8217;t no more savvee than a fool cat motherin&#8217; a china
dog, but he&#8217;s got the grit o&#8217; ten men. He&#8217;s hunted out
James with no more thought than he&#8217;d use firin&#8217; a cracker
on the 4th o&#8217; July. He goes after him to claim his right,
as calm an&#8217; foolish as a sheep in a butcherin&#8217; yard. An&#8217;
I&#8217;d say right here ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t one of us in this store would
have had the grit chasin&#8217; for his wife wher&#8217; Zip&#8217;s bin
chasin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for a wife, sure,&#8221; interjected Sandy.</p>
<p>Toby smothered a laugh, but became serious under
Sunny&#8217;s contemptuous eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s like you, Sandy,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;It&#8217;s sure like you.
But I tell you Zip&#8217;s a man, an&#8217; a great big man to the marrer
of his small backbone. His luck&#8217;s rotten. Rotten every
ways. He&#8217;s stuck on his wife, an&#8217; she&#8217;s gone off with a
tough like James. He works so he comes nigh shamin&#8217; even
me, who hates work, on a claim that couldn&#8217;t show the
color o&#8217; gold on it, if ther&#8217; wa&#8217;an&#8217;t nothin&#8217; to the earth but
gold. He&#8217;s jest got two notions in his silly head. It&#8217;s his
kids an&#8217; his wife. Mackinaw! It makes me sick. It does
sure. Here&#8217;s us fellers without a care to our souls, while
that pore sucker&#8217;s jest strugglin&#8217; an&#8217; strugglin&#8217; an&#8217; everythin&#8217;s
wrong with him&ndash;&ndash;wrong as&ndash;&ndash;oh, hell!&#8221;</p>
<p>For once Sandy forgot his malicious jibe at the loafer&#8217;s
expense. And Toby, too, forgot his pleasantry. Sunny&#8217;s
outburst of feeling had struck home, and each man stood
staring thoughtfully at the mental picture he had conjured
for them. Each admitted to himself in his own way the
pity the other&#8217;s words had stirred, but none of them had
anything to add at the moment.</p>
<p>Sunny glanced from one to the other. His look was half
questioning and wholly angry. He glanced across at the
window and thrust his hands in his ragged trousers pockets.</p>
<p>And presently as he began to tap the floor with his foot
a fresh rush of fiery anger was mounting to his head. He
opened his lips as though about to continue his tirade, but
apparently changed his mind. And, instead, he drew a
dollar bill from his pocket, and flung it on the counter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three more drinks,&#8221; he demanded roughly.</p>
<p>Minky in unfeigned surprise produced the glasses.
Sandy leant over, and, with face thrust forward, inspected
the bill. Toby contented himself with a low whistle of
astonishment.</p>
<p>Sunny glared at them contemptuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said roughly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve earned it. I&#8217;ve worked for
it, do you understand? Wild Bill set me to look after
Zip&#8217;s kids, an&#8217; he&#8217;s paid me for it. But&ndash;&ndash;but that money
burns&ndash;&ndash;burns like hell, an&#8217; I want to be quit of it. Oh, I
ain&#8217;t bug on no sort o&#8217; charity racket, I&#8217;m jest about as soft
as my back teeth. But I&#8217;m mad&ndash;&ndash;mad to git busy doin&#8217;
anythin&#8217; so we ken git Zip level with that low-down skunk,
James. An&#8217; if ther&#8217;s fi&#8217; cents&#8217; worth o&#8217; grit in you, Mister
Sandy Joyce, an&#8217; an atom o&#8217; savvee in your fool brain, Toby,
you&#8217;ll take a hand in the game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minky looked on in silent approval. Anything directed
against James was bound to meet with his approval just
now. But Sandy cleared his throat, and lounged with his
back against the counter.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; wot, I&#8217;d ast, is goin&#8217; to hurt this tough?&#8221; he inquired,
with a dash of his usual sarcasm.</p>
<p>Sunny flew at his drink and gulped it down.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do I know?&#8221; he cried scornfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toby grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a bright one, Sunny. You&#8217;re so bright, you
dazzle my eyes,&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>But Sunny was absorbed in a thought that was hazily
hovering in the back of his brain, and let the insult pass.</p>
<p>&#8220;How ken I tell jest wot we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to do,&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Wot we want to do is to kind o&#8217; help that pore crittur Zip
out first. Ther&#8217; he is wi&#8217; two kids to see to, which is sure
more than one man&#8217;s work, an&#8217; at the same time he&#8217;s got
to dig up that mudbank claim of his. He don&#8217;t see the
thing&#8217;s impossible, &#8217;cos he&#8217;s that big in mind he can&#8217;t see
small things like that. But I ain&#8217;t big that aways, an&#8217; I ken
see. If he goes on diggin&#8217; wot&#8217;s his kids goin&#8217; to do, an&#8217; if
he don&#8217;t dig wot&#8217;s they goin&#8217; to do anyways. We&#8217;ll hev to
form a committee&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sort o&#8217; trust,&#8221; grinned Toby.</p>
<p>But Sunny passed over his levity and seized upon his
suggestion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;lows your fool head&#8217;s tho&#8217;t somethin&#8217; wiser than it
guessed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s just wot we need. Ther&#8217;
should be a trust to see after him. An&#8217; after it&#8217;s got his
kids fixed right&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny broke off as the tall figure of Wild Bill threw its
shadow across the window of the store. The next moment
the man himself entered the room.</p>
<p>He nodded silently, and was about to fling himself into
one of the chairs, when Toby, in jocular anticipation, threw
Sunny&#8217;s proposition at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Sunny&#8217;s woke up an&#8217; bin thinkin&#8217;,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I
allow his brain is shockin&#8217; wonderful. Guess he&#8217;s got sick
o&#8217; restin&#8217; an&#8217; reckons he got a notion for makin&#8217; a trust lay-out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Zip Trust,&#8221; added Sandy, with a laugh, in which
Toby joined heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He guesses Zip needs lookin&#8217; after,&#8221; declared the
remittance man in the midst of his mirth, glancing round
for appreciation of the joke.</p>
<p>But the encouragement he received fell short of his expectations,
and his laugh died out quite abruptly. There was
no responsive smile on Minky&#8217;s face. Sunny was glowering
sulkily; while Bill&#8217;s fierce brows were drawn together in
an angry frown, and his gimlet eyes seemed to bore their
way into the speaker&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal?&#8221; he demanded coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, I think he&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Bill cut him short in his coldest manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you?&#8221; he observed icily. &#8220;Wal, I&#8217;d say you best
think ag&#8217;in. An&#8217; when you done thinkin&#8217; jest start right
over ag&#8217;in. An&#8217; mebbe some day you&#8217;ll get wise&ndash;&ndash;if you
don&#8217;t get took meanwhiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill flung himself into the chair and crossed his long
legs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunny&#8217;s on the right lay,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;Ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t
many men on Sufferin&#8217; Creek, but Zip&#8217;s one of &#8217;em. Say,
Toby, would you ride out to James&#8217; outfit to call him all
you think of the feller whose stole your wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not by a sight,&#8221; replied Toby seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, Zip did. He&#8217;s big,&#8221; went on Bill in cold, harsh
tones. Then he paused in thought. But he went on almost
immediately. &#8220;We got to help him. I&#8217;m sure with
Sunny.&#8221; He turned on the loafer with a wintry smile.
&#8220;You best organize right away, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;count me in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny&#8217;s eyes glowed with triumph. He had feared the
man&#8217;s ridicule. He had expected to see his lean shoulders
go up in silent contempt. And then, he knew, would have
followed a storm of sarcasm and &#8220;jollying&#8221; from Sandy
and the others. With quick wit he seized his opportunity,
bent on using Bill&#8217;s influence to its utmost. He turned on
Minky with a well calculated abruptness.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll help this thing out&ndash;&ndash;too?&#8221; he challenged
him.</p>
<p>And he got his answer on the instant&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure will&ndash;&ndash;to any extent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy and Toby looked at the storekeeper in some doubt.
Bill was watching them with a curious intentness. And
before Sunny could challenge the two scoffers, his harsh
voice filled the room again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know we&#8217;ll need any more,&#8221; he said, abruptly
turning his gaze upon the open window, &#8220;otherwise we&#8217;d
likely hev ast you two fellers. Y&#8217;see, we&#8217;ll need folks as ken
do things&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wot sort o&#8217; things?&#8221; demanded Sandy, with a sudden
interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, that ain&#8217;t easy to say right now, but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t much seein&#8217; to kids,&#8221; cried Sandy, &#8220;but I ken do
most anythin&#8217; else.&#8221;</p>
<p>A flicker of a smile crept into Bill&#8217;s averted eyes, while
Sunny grinned broadly to see the way the man was now
literally falling over himself to follow the leadership of Wild
Bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, it ain&#8217;t no use in saying things yet, but if you&#8217;re
dead set on joining this Zip Trust, I guess you can. But
get this, what you&#8217;re called upon to do you&#8217;ll need to do
good an&#8217; hard, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;without argument.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in,&#8221; he cried, as though a great privilege had been
bestowed upon him.</p>
<p>And at once Toby became anxious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you ain&#8217;t no use for me, Bill?&#8221; he hazarded,
almost diffidently.</p>
<p>Bill turned his steely eyes on him in cold contemplation.
Minky had joined in Sunny&#8217;s grin at the other men&#8217;s expense.
Sandy, too, now that he was accepted as an active
member of the trust, was indulging in a superior smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t allow I have,&#8221; Bill said slowly. &#8220;Y&#8217;see, you
ain&#8217;t much else than a &#8216;remittance&#8217; man, an&#8217; they ain&#8217;t no
sort o&#8217; trash anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; protested Toby, &#8220;I can&#8217;t help it if my folks hand
me money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe you can&#8217;t.&#8221; Bill was actually smiling. And this
fact so far influenced the other members of the trust that
an audible titter went round the room. Then the gambler
suddenly sat forward, and the old fierce gleam shone once
more in his cold eyes. &#8220;Say,&#8221; he cried suddenly. &#8220;If a
feller got the &#8216;drop&#8217; on you with six bar&#8217;ls of a gun
well-loaded, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;guessed you&#8217;d best squeal, wot &#8217;ud you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Squeal,&#8221; responded the puzzled Toby, with alacrity.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ken join the Trust. You sure got more savvee
than I tho&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill sat back grinning, while a roar of laughter concluded
the founding of the Zip Trust.</p>
<p>But like all ceremonials, the matter had to be prolonged
and surrounded with the frills of officialdom. Sunny called
it organization, and herein only copied people of greater
degree and self-importance. He plunged into his task with
whole-hearted enthusiasm, and, with every word he uttered,
preened himself in the belief that he was rapidly ascending
in the opinion of Wild Bill, the only man on Suffering Creek
for whose opinion he cared a jot.</p>
<p>He explained to his comrades, with all the vanity of a
man whose inspiration has met with public approval, that
in forming such a combine as theirs, it would be necessary
to allot certain work, which he called &#8220;departments,&#8221;
to certain individuals. He assured his fellow-members
that such was always done in &#8220;way-up concerns.&#8221; It saved
confusion, and ensured the work being adequately performed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sort o&#8217; like a noo elected gover&#8217;ment,&#8221; suggested Sandy
sapiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, I won&#8217;t say that,&#8221; said Sunny. &#8220;Them fellers
traipse around wi&#8217; portyfolios hangin&#8217; to &#8217;em. I don&#8217;t guess
we need them things. It&#8217;s too hot doin&#8217; stunts like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Portfolios?&#8221; questioned Toby artlessly. &#8220;Wot&#8217;s them
for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, jest nuthin&#8217; o&#8217; consequence. Guess it&#8217;s to make
folks guess they&#8217;re doin&#8217; a heap o&#8217; work. No, what we need
is to set each man his work this aways. Now Bill here
needs to be president sure. Y&#8217;see, we must hev a &#8216;pres.&#8217;
Most everything needs a &#8216;pres.&#8217; He&#8217;s got to sit on top, so
if any one o&#8217; the members gits gay he ken hand &#8217;em a daisy
wot&#8217;ll send &#8217;em squealin&#8217; an&#8217; huntin&#8217; their holes like gophers.
Wal, Bill needs to be our &#8216;pres.&#8217; Then there&#8217;s the &#8216;general
manager.&#8217; He&#8217;s the feller wot sets around an&#8217; blames most
everybody fer everything anyway, an&#8217; writes to the noospapers.
He&#8217;s got to have savvee, an&#8217; an elegant way o&#8217; shiftin&#8217; the responsibility o&#8217; things on them as can&#8217;t git
back at him. He&#8217;s got to be a bright lad&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Sunny, sure,&#8221; exclaimed Toby. &#8220;He&#8217;s a dandy
at gettin&#8217; out o&#8217; things an&#8217; leaving others in. Say&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, half-a-tick,&#8221; cried Joyce, with sudden inspiration.
&#8220;Who&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be &#8216;fightin&#8217; editor&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, what a brain!&#8221; cried Sunny derisively. &#8220;Say, we
ain&#8217;t runnin&#8217; a mornin&#8217; noos sheet. This is a trust. Sandy,
my boy, you need educatin&#8217;. A trust&#8217;s a corporation of
folks wot is so crooked, they got to git together, an&#8217; pool
their cash, so&#8217;s to git enough dollars to kep &#8217;em out o&#8217; penitentiary.
That&#8217;s how they start. Later on, if they kep
clear o&#8217; the penitentiary, they start in to fake the market till
the Gover&#8217;ment butts in. Then they git gay, buy up a vote
in Congress, an&#8217; fake the laws so they&#8217;re fixed right fer
themselves. After that some of them git religion, some of
&#8217;em give trick feeds to their friends, some of &#8217;em start in to
hang jewels on stage females. Some of &#8217;em have been
known to shoot theirselves or git divorced. It ain&#8217;t no sort
o&#8217; matter wot they do, pervided they&#8217;re civil to the noospaper
folk. That&#8217;s a trust, Sandy, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t say but what the feller
as tho&#8217;t o&#8217; that name must o&#8217; bin a tarnation amusin&#8217;
feller.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you orter bin in a cirkis,&#8221; sneered Sandy, as the
loafer finished his disquisition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s better&#8217;n a museum,&#8221; retorted Sunny.</p>
<p>But Toby was impatient to hear how Sunny intended to
dispose of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wher&#8217; do I figger in this lay-out?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; Sunny&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;Don&#8217;t guess we&#8217;ll
need to give you hard work. You best be boss o&#8217; the
workin&#8217; staff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t no workin&#8217; staff,&#8221; protested Toby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest so. That&#8217;s why you&#8217;ll be boss of it.&#8221; Then Sunny
turned to Sandy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll need your experience as a married man, tho&#8217;,&#8221; he
said slyly. &#8220;So you best be head o&#8217; the advisory board.
You&#8217;ll need to kep us wise to the general principles of vittlin&#8217;
a family of three, when the woman&#8217;s missin&#8217;. Then we&#8217;ll
need a treasurer.&#8221; Sunny turned to Minky, and his twinkling
eyes asked the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Minky promptly, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be treasurer. Seems
to me I&#8217;ll be safer that ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; cried Sunny, &#8220;that&#8217;s all fixed.&#8221; He turned to
Bill. &#8220;Say, pres,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to pass a vote o&#8217;
thanks fer the way you conducted this yer meetin&#8217;, an&#8217; put
it to the vote, that we accept the treasurer&#8217;s invitation to
take wine. All in favor will&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine&#8217;s rye,&#8221; cried Sandy promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; mine,&#8221; added Toby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rye for me,&#8221; nodded Sunny at Minky&#8217;s grinning face.
&#8220;Bill&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Bill shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too early for me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you fellers can git all you
need into you though. But see here, folks,&#8221; he went on,
with a quietness of purpose that promptly reduced every eye
to seriousness. &#8220;This ain&#8217;t no play game as Sunny may ha&#8217;
made you think. It&#8217;s a proposition that needs to go thro&#8217;,
an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to see it thro&#8217;. Zip&#8217;s kids is our first trouble.
They ain&#8217;t easy handlin&#8217;. They got to be bro&#8217;t up reg&#8217;lar,
an&#8217; their stummicks ain&#8217;t to be pizened with no wrong sort
o&#8217; vittles. Ther&#8217;s such a heap o&#8217; things to kids o&#8217; that age
it makes me nigh sweat at the tho&#8217;t. Howsum, Zip&#8217;s down
an&#8217; out, an&#8217; we got to see him right someways. As &#8216;pres&#8217;
of this lay-out, I tell you right here, every mother&#8217;s son of
us had best git out an&#8217; learn all we ken about fixin&#8217; kids
right. How to feed &#8217;em, how to set their pretties on right,
how to clean &#8217;em, how to&ndash;&ndash;well, jest how to raise &#8217;em. If
any o&#8217; you got leddy friends I&#8217;d say git busy askin&#8217; &#8217;em.
So&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment the sound of footsteps on the veranda
came in through the window, and Bill looked round. The
next instant he spoke more rapidly, and with greater
authority.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git goin&#8217;,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;an&#8217; we&#8217;ll meet after supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no doubt of this man&#8217;s rule. Without a word
the men filed out of the store, each one with his thoughts
bent upon the possibilities of acquiring the knowledge
necessary.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>STRANGERS IN SUFFERING CREEK</h3>
</div>
<p>Bill watched the men depart. The stolid Minky, too,
followed them with his eyes. But as they disappeared
through the doorway he turned to the gambler, and, in surprise,
discovered that he was reclining in a chair, stretched
out in an attitude of repose, with his shrewd eyes tightly
closed. He was about to speak when the swing-doors
opened, and two strangers strolled in.</p>
<p>Minky greeted them, &#8220;Howdy?&#8221; and received an amiable
response. The newcomers were ordinary enough to satisfy
even the suspicious storekeeper. In fact, they looked like
men from some city, who had possibly come to Suffering
Creek with the purpose of ascertaining the possibilities of
the camp as a place in which to try their fortunes. Both
were clad in store clothes of fair quality, wearing hats of the
black prairie type, and only the extreme tanning of their
somewhat genial faces belied the city theory.</p>
<p>Minky noted all these things while he served them the
drinks they called for, and, in the most approvedly casual
manner, put the usual question to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wher&#8217; you from?&#8221; he inquired, as though the matter
were not of the least consequence.</p>
<p>He was told Spawn City without hesitation, and in response
to his remark that they had &#8220;come quite a piece,&#8221;
they equally amiably assured him that they had.</p>
<p>Then one of the men addressed his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Joe,&#8221; he said, &#8220;mebbe this guy ken put us wise to
things.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Joe nodded and turned to the storekeeper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, boss,&#8221; he began, &#8220;we&#8217;ve heerd tell this lay-out is a
dead gut bonanza. There&#8217;s folks in Spawn City says ther&#8217;s
gold enough here to drown the United States Treasury department.
Guess we come along to gather some.&#8221; He
grinned in an ingratiating manner.</p>
<p>Minky thought before answering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217; sure is a heap o&#8217; gold around. But it ain&#8217;t easy.
I don&#8217;t guess you&#8217;d gather much in a shovel. You&#8217;ll get
pay dirt that aways, but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Needs cap&#8217;tal,&#8221; suggested Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s jest how we figgered,&#8221; put in the other quietly.</p>
<p>Minky nodded. Many things were traveling swiftly
through his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drove in?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; replied Joe. &#8220;Unhooked down the trail a piece.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill&#8217;s eyes opened and closed again. Then he shifted
noisily in his chair. The men turned round and eyed him
with interest. Then the man called Joe called back to the
storekeeper.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Joe Manton,&#8221; he said, by way of introduction.
&#8220;An&#8217; my friend&#8217;s called Sim Longley. Say,&#8221; he
went on, with a backward jerk of the head, &#8220;mebbe your
friend&#8217;ll take something?&#8221;</p>
<p>Minky glanced over at Wild Bill. The gambler drowsily
opened his eyes and bestirred himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure will,&#8221; he said, rearing his great length up, and
moving across to the counter. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take Rye, mister, an&#8217;
thank you. This is Mr. Minky, gents. My name&#8217;s Bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>The introduction acknowledged, talk flowed freely. Wild
Bill, in carefully toned down manner, engaged the strangers
in polite talk, answering their questions about the gold prospects
of the place, which were often pointed, in the most
genial and even loquacious manner. He told them a great
deal of the history of the place, warned them that Suffering
Creek was not the sinecure the outside world had been told,
endorsed Minky&#8217;s story that what Suffering Creek really
needed was capital to reach the true wealth of the place.
And, in the course of the talk, drink flowed freely.</p>
<p>Bill was always supplied with his drink from a different
bottle to that out of which the strangers were served. As
a matter of fact, he was probably the most temperate man
on Suffering Creek, and, by an arrangement with Minky, so
as not to spoil trade, drank from a bottle of colored water
when the necessity for refreshment arose. But just now
his manner suggested that he had drunk quite as much
whisky as the strangers. His spirits rose with theirs, and
his jocularity and levity matched theirs, step by step, as they
went on talking.</p>
<p>The man Longley had spoken of the settlement as being
&#8220;one-horsed,&#8221; and Billy promptly agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sure is,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;We ain&#8217;t got nothing but this
yer canteen, with ol&#8217; Minky doin&#8217; his best to pizen us. Still,
we get along in a ways. Mebbe we could do wi&#8217; a dancin&#8217;-hall&ndash;&ndash;if
we had females around. Then I&#8217;d say a bank
would be an elegant addition to things. Y&#8217;see, we hev to
ship our gold outside. Leastways, that&#8217;s wot we used to do,
I&#8217;ve heard. Y&#8217;see, I ain&#8217;t in the minin&#8217; business,&#8221; he
added, by way of accounting for his lack of personal
knowledge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re &#8216;commercial&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill laughed so genially that the others joined in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a ways, mebbe I am. You see, I mostly sit around,
an&#8217; when anything promisin&#8217; comes along, why, I ain&#8217;t above
plankin&#8217; a few dollars by way of&ndash;&ndash;speculation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe grinned broadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few shares in a poker hand, eh?&#8221; he suggested
shrewdly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re kind o&#8217; quick, mister,&#8221; Bill laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;m stuck
on &#8216;draw&#8217; some.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the talk drifted suddenly. It was Longley who
presently harked back to the commercial side of Suffering
Creek.</p>
<p>&#8220;You was sayin&#8217; ther&#8217; wasn&#8217;t no bank on Suffering
Creek,&#8221; he said interestedly. &#8220;What do folks do with their
dust now, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>A quick but almost imperceptible glance passed between
Bill and the storekeeper. And Bill&#8217;s answer came at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, as I sed, we used to pass it out by stage. But&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Longley caught him up just a shade too quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&ndash;&ndash;but?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; drawled Bill thoughtfully, &#8220;y&#8217;see, we ain&#8217;t
shipped dust out for some time on account of a gang that&#8217;s
settin&#8217; around waitin&#8217;. You comin&#8217; from Spawn City&#8217;ll
likely have heard of this feller James an&#8217; his gang. A most
ter&#8217;ble tough is James. I&#8217;ll allow he&#8217;s got us mighty nigh
wher&#8217; he wants us&ndash;&ndash;scairt to death. No, we ain&#8217;t sent out
no gold stage lately, but we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to right soon. We&#8217;ll
hev to. We&#8217;ve ast for an escort o&#8217; Gover&#8217;ment troops, but
I guess Sufferin&#8217; Creek ain&#8217;t on the map. The Gover&#8217;ment
don&#8217;t guess they&#8217;ve any call to worry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what you goin&#8217; to do?&#8221; inquired Longley, profoundly
interested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say. The stage&#8217;ll hev to take its chances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; when&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; began Longley. But his comrade cut him
short.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, I&#8217;ll allow the gold racket&#8217;s mighty int&#8217;restin&#8217;, but
it makes me tired this weather. You was speakin&#8217;
&#8216;draw&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; responded Bill amiably. &#8220;We&#8217;re four here, if
you fancy a hand. Minky?&#8221;</p>
<p>The storekeeper nodded, and promptly produced cards and
&#8216;chips.&#8217; And in five minutes the game was in progress.
Used as he was to the vagaries of his gambling friend,
Minky was puzzled at the way he was discussing Suffering
Creek with these strangers. His talk about James and the
gold-stage was too rankly absurd for anything, and yet he
knew that some subtle purpose must be underlying his talk.
However, it was no time to question or contradict now, so
he accepted the situation and his share in the game.</p>
<p>And here again astonishment awaited him. Bill lost
steadily, if not heavily. He watched the men closely, but
could discover none of the known tricks common to the
game when sharps are at work. They not only seemed to
be playing straight, but badly. They were not good poker
players. Yet they got the hands and won. For himself, he
kept fairly level. It was only Bill who lost.</p>
<p>And all through the game the gambler allowed himself
to be drawn into talking of Suffering Creek by the interested
Longley, until it would have been obvious to the veriest
greenhorn that the stranger was pumping him.</p>
<p>The newcomers seemed to be enjoying themselves enormously,
and the greatest good-will prevailed. Nor was it
until nearly supper-time that Bill suddenly stood up and
declared he had had enough. He was a loser to the extent
of nearly a hundred dollars.</p>
<p>So the party broke up. And at Minky&#8217;s suggestion the
men departed to put their horses in the barn, while they
partook of supper under his roof. It was the moment they
had gone that the storekeeper turned on his friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, I ain&#8217;t got you, Bill. Wot&#8217;s your game?&#8221; he demanded,
with some asperity.</p>
<p>But the gambler was quite undisturbed by his annoyance.
He only chuckled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he countered, &#8220;ever heerd tell of Swanny Long,
the biggest tough in Idaho?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. But&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s him&ndash;&ndash;that feller Sim Longley.&#8221;</p>
<p>The storekeeper stared.</p>
<p>&#8220;You sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure? Gee! I was after him fer nigh three&ndash;&ndash;Say,&#8221;
he broke off&ndash;&ndash;it was not his way to indulge in reminiscence&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I
guess he&#8217;s workin&#8217; with James.&#8221; Then he laughed.
&#8220;Gee! I allow he was rigged elegant&ndash;&ndash;most like some Bible-smashin&#8217;
sky-pilot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minky was still laboring hard to understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;But all that yarn of the gold-stage?&#8221; he said sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;That?&#8221; Bill at once became serious. &#8220;Wal, that&#8217;s
pretty near right. You ain&#8217;t yearnin&#8217; fer that gang to come
snoopin&#8217; around Suffering Creek. So I&#8217;m guessin&#8217; we&#8217;ll hev
to pass a gold-stage out o&#8217; her some time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re mad,&#8221; cried Minky in consternation.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s as may be,&#8221; retorted Bill, quite unruffled.
&#8220;Anyways, I guess I spent a hundred dollars in a mighty
good deal this day&ndash;&ndash;if it was rotten bad poker.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he turned away to talk to Slade of Kentucky, who
entered the store at that moment with his friend O&#8217;Brien.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XII_THE_WOMAN' id='CHAPTER_XII_THE_WOMAN'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE WOMAN</h3>
</div>
<p>The woman turned from the window at the sound of
footsteps somewhere behind her. That was her way now.
She started at each fresh sound that suggested anyone approaching.
Her nerves were on edge for some reason she
could never have put into words. She did not fear, yet a
curious nervousness was hers which made her listen acutely
at every footstep, and breathe her relief if the sound died
away without further intrusion upon her privacy.</p>
<p>Presently she turned back to the window with just such
relief. The footstep had passed. She drew her feet up into
the ample seat of the rocking-chair, and, with her elbow
resting upon its arm, heavily pressed her chin into the palm
of her hand, and again stared at the rampart of mountains
beyond.</p>
<p>Nor had all the beauties spread out before her yearning
gaze the least appeal for her. How should they? Her
thoughts were roaming in a world of her own, and her eyes
were occupied in gazing upon her woman&#8217;s pictures as she
saw them in her mind. The wonders of that scene of natural
splendor laid out before her had no power to penetrate
the armor of her preoccupation. All her mind and heart
were stirred and torn by emotions such as only a woman can
understand, only a woman can feel. The ancient battle of
titanic forces, which had brought into existence that world
of stupendous might upon which her unseeing eyes gazed,
was as nothing, it seemed, to the passionate struggle going
on in her torn heart. To her there was nothing beyond her
own regretful misery, her own dread of the future, her
passionate revulsion at thoughts of the past.</p>
<p>The truth was, she had not yet found the happiness she
had promised herself, that had been promised to her. She
had left behind her all that life which, when it had been
hers, she had hated. Her passionate nature had drawn her
whither its stormy waves listed. And now that the tempest
was passed, and the driving forces had ceased to urge, leaving
her in a rock-bound pool of reflection, she saw the
enormity of the step she had taken, she realized the strength
of Nature&#8217;s tendrils which still bound her no less surely.</p>
<p>The mild face of Scipio haunted her. She saw in her
remorseful fancy his wondering blue eyes filled with the
stricken look of a man powerless to resent, powerless to
resist. She read into her thought the feelings of his simple
heart which she had so wantonly crushed. For she knew his
love as only a woman can. She had probed its depth and
found it fathomless&ndash;&ndash;fathomless in its devotion to herself.
And now she had thrown him and his love, the great
legitimate love of the father of her children, headlong out
of her life.</p>
<p>A dozen times she bolstered her actions with the assurance
that she did not want his love, that he was not the man she
had ever cared for seriously, could ever care for. She told
herself that the insignificance of his character, his personality,
were beneath contempt. She desired a man of strength
for her partner, a man who could make himself of some
account in the world which was theirs.</p>
<p>No, she did not want Scipio. He was useless in the
scheme of life, and she did not wish to have to &#8220;mother&#8221;
her husband. Far rather would she be the slave of a man
whose ruthless domination extended even to herself. And
yet Scipio&#8217;s mild eyes haunted her, and stirred something in
her heart that maddened her, and robbed her of all satisfaction
in the step she had taken.</p>
<p>But this was only a small part of the cause of her present
mood. She had not at first had the vaguest understanding
of the bonds which really fettered her, holding her fast to
the life that had been hers for so long. Now she knew.
And the knowledge brought with it its bitter cost. Some
forewarning had been hers when she appealed to her lover
for the possession of her children. But although her
mother&#8217;s instinct had been stirred to alarm at parting, she
had not, at that time, experienced the real horror of what
she was doing in abandoning her children.</p>
<p>She was inconsolable now. With all her mind and heart
she was crying out for the warm, moist pressure of infant
lips. Her whole body yearned for those who were flesh of
her flesh, for the gentle beating hearts to which her body
had given life. They were hers&ndash;&ndash;hers, and of her own
action she had put them out of her life. They were hers,
and she was maddened at the thought that she had left them
to another. They were hers, and&ndash;&ndash;yes, she must have
them. Whatever happened, they must be restored to her.
Life would be intolerable without them.</p>
<p>She was in a wholly unreasoning state of mind. All the
mother in her was uppermost, craving, yearning, panting for
her own. For the time, at least, all else was lost in an
overwhelming regret, and such a power of love for her
offspring, that she had no room for the man who had
brought about the separation.</p>
<p>She was a selfish woman, and had always craved for the
best that life could give her, but now that her mother-love
was truly roused her selfishness knew no bounds. She had
no thought for anybody, no consideration. She could have
none until her desire was satisfied.</p>
<p>Her tortured heart grew angry against Scipio. She was
driven to fury against James. What mattered it that her
lover had so far fulfilled all his other promises to her, if he
did not procure the children and return them to her arms?
What mattered it that she was surrounded with luxury
uncommon on the prairie, a luxury she had not known for
so many years?</p>
<p>She had her own rooms, where no one intruded without
her consent. The spacious house had been ransacked to
make them all that she could desire. All the outlaw&#8217;s
associates were herded into the background, lest their presence
should offend her. Even James himself had refrained
from forcing his attentions upon her, lest, in the first rush of
feeling at her breaking with the old life, they should be
unwelcome. His patience and restraint were wonderful in
a man of his peculiar savagery. And surely it pointed his
love for her. Had it been simply the momentary passion of
an untamed nature, he would have waited for nothing, when
once she had become his possession.</p>
<p>It was a curious anachronism that she should be the
mistress of the situation with such a man as James. Yet so
far she was mistress of the situation. The question was,
how long would she remain so? It is possible that she had
no understanding of this at first. It is possible that she
would have resented such a question, had it occurred to
her when she first consented to break away from her old
life.</p>
<p>But now it was different. Now that she began to understand
all she had flung away for this man, when the mother
in her was at last fully aroused, and all her wits were driven
headlong to discover a way by which to satisfy her all-consuming
desire for her children, now the native cunning of
the woman asserted itself. She saw in one revealing flash
her position, she saw where lay her power at the moment,
and she clung to it desperately, determined to play the man
while she could to gain her ends.</p>
<p>Thus it was she was nervous, apprehensive, every time
she thought it likely that her lover was about to visit her.
She dreaded what might transpire. She dreaded lest her
power should be weakened before she had accomplished her
end. It was difficult; it was nerve-racking. She must keep
his love at fever-heat. It was her one chance.</p>
<p>Again she started. It was the sound of a fresh footstep
beyond the door. She glanced at the door with half-startled
eyes and sat listening. Then her lips closed decidedly and
a look of purpose crept into her eyes. A moment later she
stood up. She was pale, but full of purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that you, Jim?&#8221; she called.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; came the ready response.</p>
<p>The next instant the door was flung open and the man
came in.</p>
<p>His bronzed face was smiling, and the savage in him was
hidden deep down out of sight. His handsome face was
good to look upon, and as the woman&#8217;s eyes surveyed his
carefully clad slim figure she felt a thrill of triumph at the
thought that he was hers at the raising of her finger.</p>
<p>But she faced him without any responsive smile. She had
summoned him with a very definite purpose in her mind,
and no display of anything that could be interpreted into
weakness must be made.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to talk to you,&#8221; she said, pointing at the rocking-chair
she had just vacated.</p>
<p>James glanced at the chair. Then his eyes turned back
to her with a question in them. Finally he shrugged his
shoulders and flung himself into the seat, and stretched out
his long legs luxuriously.</p>
<p>Apparently Jessie had not noticed the shrug. It would
have been better had she done so. She might then have
understood more fully the man she was dealing with. However,
she turned to the window and spoke with her back to
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about&ndash;&ndash;things,&#8221; she said a little lamely.</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s smile was something ironical, as his eyes
greedily devoured the beauty of her figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; he said in a non-committing way. Then, as
no reply was immediately forthcoming, he added, &#8220;Get
going.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jessie made no answer. She was thinking hard, and
somehow her thoughts had an uneasy confusion in them.
She was trying hard to find the best way to begin that which
she had to say, but every opening seemed inadequate. She
must not appeal, she must not dictate. She must adopt some
middle course. These things she felt instinctively.</p>
<p>The man shifted his position and glanced round the
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kind of snug here,&#8221; he said pleasantly, running his eyes
appreciatively over the simple decorations, the cheap bric-&agrave;-brac
which lined the walls and, in a world where all decoration
was chiefly conspicuous by its absence, gave to the place
a suggestion of richness. The red pine walls looked warm,
and the carpeted floor was so unusual as to give one a feeling
of extraordinary refinement. Then, too, the chairs, scattered
about, spoke of a strain after civilized luxury. The
whole ranch-house had been turned inside out to make
Jessie&#8217;s quarters all she could desire them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;it&#8217;s sure snug.&#8221; Then his eyes
came back to the woman. &#8220;Maybe there&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve
forgotten. Guess you&#8217;ve just got to fix a name to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessie turned instantly. Her beautiful eyes were shining
with a sudden hope, but her face was pale with a hardly
controlled emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I want my children. I want
little Vada. I&ndash;&ndash;I must have her. You promised I should.
If you hadn&#8217;t, I should never have left. I must have her.&#8221;
She spoke breathlessly, and broke off with a sort of nervous
jolt.</p>
<p>In the pause that followed James&#8217; expression underwent a
subtle change. It was not that there was any definite movement
of a single muscle. His smile remained, but, somehow,
through it peeped a hard look which had not been there
before.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you want&ndash;&ndash;the kids,&#8221; he said at last, and a curious
metallic quality was in his voice. &#8220;Say,&#8221; he added thoughtfully,
&#8220;you women are queer ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we are,&#8221; retorted Jessie. She tried to laugh as
she spoke, but it was a dismal failure. Then she hurried
on. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she cried a little shrilly, &#8220;it was part of our
bargain, and&ndash;&ndash;so far you have not carried it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bargain?&#8221; The man&#8217;s brows went up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, bargain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember a&ndash;&ndash;bargain.&#8221; James&#8217; eyes had in
them an ominous glitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ve got a bad memory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure haven&#8217;t, Jess. I sure haven&#8217;t that. I generally
remember good. And what I remember now is that I promised
you those kids if you needed them. I swore that you
should have &#8217;em. But I made no bargain. Guess women
don&#8217;t see things dead right. This is the first time you&#8217;ve
spoken to me of this, and you say I haven&#8217;t fulfilled my
bargain. When I refuse to give you them kiddies, it&#8217;s time
to take that tone. You want them kids. Well&ndash;&ndash;go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The change in her lover&#8217;s manner warned Jessie that
danger lay ahead. In the brief time she had spent under his
roof she had already learned that, as yet, she had only seen
the gentlest side of the man, and that the other side was
always perilously near the surface.</p>
<p>In the beginning this had been rather a delight to her to
think that she, of all people, was privileged to bask in the
sunny side of a man who habitually displayed the storm
clouds of his fiercer side to the world in general. But since
that time a change, which she neither knew nor understood,
had come over her, and, instead of rejoicing that he possessed
that harsher nature, she rather feared it, feared that
it might be turned upon her.</p>
<p>It was this change that had helped to bring her woman&#8217;s
cunning into play. It was this change which had brought
her her haunting visions of the old life. It was this change
which had prompted her that she must keep her lover at
arm&#8217;s length&ndash;&ndash;as yet. It was this change, had she paused
to analyze it, which might have told her of the hideous mistake
she had made. That the passion which she had believed
to be an absorbing love for the man was merely a passion,
a base human passion, inspired in a weak, discontented
woman. But as yet she understood nothing of this. The
glamour of the man&#8217;s personality still had power to sway
her, and she acknowledged it in her next words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be angry, Jim dear,&#8221; she said, with a smile of
seductive sweetness which had immediate effect upon the
man. &#8220;You don&#8217;t understand us women. We&#8217;re sure unreasonable
where our love is concerned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then a flush spread itself slowly over her handsome face,
and passion lit her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I must have my children,&#8221; she broke out suddenly.
&#8220;One of them, anyhow&ndash;&ndash;little Vada. You&ndash;&ndash;you can&#8217;t
understand all it means to be away from them. They are
mine. They are part of me. I&ndash;&ndash;I feel I could kill anyone
who keeps them from me. You promised, Jim, you sure
did. Get her for me. My little girl&ndash;&ndash;my little Vada.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man had risen from his chair and moved to the
window. He sat on the rough sill facing her. His eyes
were hot with passion, too, but it was passion of a very
different sort.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I do?&#8221; he questioned subtly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you do?&#8221; Jessie&#8217;s eyes widened with a world of
cunning simplicity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if I do?&#8221; The man&#8217;s face was nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have fulfilled your promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessie had turned again to the window, and her eyes were
cold.</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s brows drew together sharply, and his dark eyes
watched the perfect outline of her oval cheek. Then he
drew a sharp breath, and biting words leapt to his lips. But
he held them back with a sudden grip that was perilously
near breaking. Jessie&#8217;s power was still enormous with him.
But this very power was maddening to a man of his nature,
and the two must not come into too frequent conflict.</p>
<p>He suddenly laughed, and the woman turned in alarm at
the note that sounded in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said tensely. &#8220;I&#8217;ll fulfill my promise. It&#8217;ll
amuse me, sure, getting back at that Sufferin&#8217; Creek lay-out.
I owe them something for keepin&#8217; back the gold-stages.
You shall have Vada, sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off for an instant and drew nearer. He leant
forward, and one arm reached out to encircle her waist.
But with an almost imperceptible movement the woman
stood beyond his reach.</p>
<p>&#8220;And&ndash;&ndash;and after?&#8221; he questioned, his arm still outstretched
to embrace her.</p>
<p>The woman made no answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;And after?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a hot glow in his tone. He waited. Then he
went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll have done everything,&#8221; he said&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;all that a
man can do to make you happy. I&#8217;ll have fulfilled all my
promises. I&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;And you?&#8221; he went on, coming close up
to her.</p>
<p>This time she did not repulse him. Instinct told her that
she must not. Before all things she wanted Vada. So his
arms closed about her, and a shower of hot, passionate kisses
fell upon her face, her hair, her lips.</p>
<p>At last she pushed him gently away. For the moment all
the old passion had been stirred, but now, as she released
herself, an odd shiver passed through her body, and a great
relief came to her as she stood out of his reach. It was the
first real, definite feeling of repulsion she had had, and as
she realized it a sudden fear gripped her heart, and she
longed to rush from his presence. But, even so, she did not
fully understand the change that was taking place in her.
Her predominating thought was for the possession of little
Vada, and she urged him with all the intensity of her
longing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get her for me?&#8221; she cried, with an excitement
that transfigured her. &#8220;You will. Oh, Jim, I can never
thank you sufficiently. You are good to me. And when
will you get her&ndash;&ndash;now? Oh, Jim, don&#8217;t wait. You must do
it now. I want her so badly. I wonder how you&#8217;ll do it.
Will you take her? Or will you ask Zip for her? I&ndash;&ndash;I
believe he would give her up. He&#8217;s such a queer fellow. I
believe he&#8217;d do anything I asked him. I sure do. How
are you going to get her?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man was watching her with all the fire of his love in
his eyes. It was a greedy, devouring gaze of which Jessie
must have been aware had she only been thinking less of her
child. Nor did he answer at once. Then slowly the passionate
light died out of his eyes, and they became thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; the woman urged him.</p>
<p>Suddenly he looked into her face with a cruel grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, Jess,&#8221; he said sharply, &#8220;and write a letter to
Zip asking him, in your best lingo, to let you have your kid.
An&#8217; when you done that I&#8217;ll see he gets it, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll see you
get the kid. But make the letter good an&#8217; hot. Pile up the
agony biz. I&#8217;ll fix the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment the woman looked into his face, now lit
with such a cruel grin. Something in her heart gave her
pause. Somehow she felt that what she was called upon to
do was intended to hurt Zip in some subtle way, and the
thought was not pleasant. She didn&#8217;t want to hurt Zip.
She tried in those few seconds to probe this man&#8217;s purpose.
But her mind was not equal to the task. Surely a letter
appealing to Zip could not really hurt him. And she wanted
little Vada so much. It was this last thought that decided
her. No, nothing should stand in her way. She steeled her
heart against her better feelings, but with some misgivings,
and sat down to write.</p>
<p>James watched her. She procured paper and pen, and he
watched her bending over the table. No detail of her face
and figure escaped his greedy eyes. She was very beautiful,
so beautiful to him that he stirred restlessly, chafing irritably
under the restraint he was putting upon himself. Again and
again he asked himself why he was fool enough to do as he
was doing. She was his. There was no one to stop him,
no one but&ndash;&ndash;her.</p>
<p>Ah! There was the trouble. Such was the man&#8217;s temper
that nothing could satisfy him that gave him no difficulty of
attaining. His was the appetite of an epicure in all things.
Everything in its way must be of the best, and to be of the
best to him it must be the most difficult of achievement.</p>
<p>He waited with what patience he could until the letter
was written. Then he watched Jessie seal and address it.
Then she rose and stood staring down at the cruel missive.
She knew it was cruel now, for, trading on the knowledge
of the man who was to receive it, she had appealed
through the channel of her woman&#8217;s weakness to all that
great spirit which she knew to abide in her little husband&#8217;s
heart.</p>
<p>James understood something of what was passing in her
mind. And it pleased him to think of what he had forced
her to do&ndash;&ndash;pleased him as cruelty ever pleases the truly
vicious.</p>
<p>At last she held the missive out to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;There it is,&#8221; she said. And as his hand closed upon it
her own was drawn sharply away, as though to avoid contact
with his.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; he said, with a peculiar grin.</p>
<p>For a moment the silence remained unbroken. Then the
woman raised appealing eyes to his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t hurt Zip?&#8221; she said in a voice that would
surely have heartened the object of her solicitude had he
heard it.</p>
<p>The man shook his head. His jaws were set, and his
smile was unpleasing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess any hurtin&#8217; Zip gets&#8217;ll be done by you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, no, no!&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman reached out wildly for the letter, but James
had passed swiftly out of the room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>BIRDIE AND THE BOYS</h3>
</div>
<p>The derelicts of a mining camp must ever be interesting
to the student of human nature, so wide is the field for study.
But it were better to be a student, simply, when probing
amongst the refuse heaps of life&#8217;s d&eacute;bris. A sentimentalist,
a man of heart, would quickly have it broken with the pity
of it all. A city&#8217;s tragedies often require search to reveal
them, but upon the frontier tragedy stalks unsepulchered
in the background of nearly every life, ready to leap out
in all its naked horror and settle itself leech-like upon
the sympathetic heart, stifling it with the burden of its
misery.</p>
<p>No, it is not good to delve into the dark pages of such
folks&#8217; lives too closely, unless armored with impenetrable
callousness. But one cannot help wondering whence all
those living tragedies come. Look at the men. For the
most part strong, able creatures, apparently capable of fighting
the lusty battle of life with undiminished ardor. Look
at the women. They are for the most part thinking women,
healthy, capable. And yet&ndash;&ndash;well, nine-tenths of them are
not so cut off from their home cities, their friends and
relatives, without some more than ordinary reason.</p>
<p>It is a sad sight to see the women plunged headlong into
the fight for existence in such places, to witness the cruel
iron thrust upon them its searing brand, to watch all the
natural softness of their sex harden to the necessary degree
for a successful issue to the battle, to witness their frequent
unsexing and ultimate degradation. Such results are common
enough when a woman enters the lists. It is so often a
mere question of time. And when the end is achieved, how
awful, how revolting, but how natural.</p>
<p>How Birdie Mason came to find herself the one woman
on Suffering Creek&ndash;&ndash;leaving out the later advent of Scipio&#8217;s
wife&ndash;&ndash;it is not for us to ask. Whatever her little tragedy
it is hers alone, and does not concern us. All that we need
think of is her future, and the pity that so well-favored a
woman has not found her lot cast in places where her
womanhood has its best chances. However, she is there,
living the life of all such hired &#8220;helps,&#8221; drudging from
morning till night in one long round of sordid labor, in
an atmosphere stinking with the fetid breath of debased
humanity.</p>
<p>But as yet the life has made no inroads upon her moral
health. Her sunny good nature sets her singing over the
most grinding labors. Her smiling face, and ready tongue,
give her an air of happiness and joy of life which seems
well-nigh invincible. And her popularity contrives her
many thrilling moments and advantages which she is too
much a woman and a child to deny herself.</p>
<p>Her day&#8217;s work ends with the after supper &#8220;wash up,&#8221; a
dreary routine which might well crush the most ardent spirit.
Yet she bends over her tubs full of crockery dreaming her
sunny dreams, building her little castles to the clink of
enameled tin cups, weaving her romances to the clatter of
cutlery, smiling upon the mentally conjured faces of her
boys amidst the steaming odors of greasy, lukewarm water.
The one blot upon her existence is perhaps the Chinese cook,
with whom she has perforce to associate. She dislikes him
for no other reason than that he is a &#8220;yaller-faced doper that
ought to been set to herd with a menagerie of measly
skunks.&#8221; But even this annoyance cannot seriously damp
her buoyancy, and, with wonderful feminine philosophy, she
puts him out of her mind as a &#8220;no account feller, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was putting the finishing touches to the long dining-table,
making it ready for the next day&#8217;s breakfast. It was
not an elaborate preparation. She &#8220;dumped&#8221; a box of
knives and forks at each end of it, and then proceeded to
chase any odd bits of d&eacute;bris from the last meal on to the floor
with a duster. Then, with a hand-broom and pan, she took
these up and with them any other rubbish that might be
lying about. Finally, she set jugs of drinking water at
intervals down the center of the table, and her work was
done.</p>
<p>She looked about her, patting her fair hair with that
eminently feminine touch which is to be seen in every
woman from the millionaire&#8217;s wife down to the poorest
emigrant. Then, with less delicacy, she lifted her apron
and wiped the moisture from her round young face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess that&#8217;s &#8217;most everything,&#8221; she murmured, her eyes
brightening at the contemplation of her completed task.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll just cut out them&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She went to a cupboard and drew out a parcel of white
lawn and paper patterns, which she carefully spread out on
the table. And, in a few moments, she was bending
absorbedly over the stuff, lost in the intricacies of hewing
out an embryonic garment for her personal adornment.</p>
<p>It was at this task that Toby Jenks found her. He was
worried to death at the thought that, as a member of the
newly formed Zip Trust, it was his duty to gather information
concerning the management of children. However, in
the midst of his trouble he hit on the brilliant idea of consulting
the only woman of his acquaintance.</p>
<p>Toby wanted to do something startling in the interests
of the Trust. He felt that his membership had been conferred
in a rather grudging spirit. And, to his mildly resentful
way of thinking, it seemed it would be a good thing
if he could surprise his friends with the excellence of his
services in the general interests of the concern.</p>
<p>Birdie heard the door open, and raised a pair of startled
eyes at the intruder. It was not that such visits were out
of order, or even uncommon, but they generally occurred
after pre-arrangement, which gave her the opportunity of
&#8220;fixing herself right.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a wild grab she scrambled her material, and the
pattern, so that its identification would be quite impossible
to male eyes, and hugged it in her arms. Turning swiftly
she thrust it into the cupboard, and slammed the door. But
she had no resentment at the interruption. Toby was quite
a new visitor, and, well&ndash;&ndash;the more the merrier.</p>
<p>She turned to him all smiles, and Toby returned her
welcome something sheepishly. He cut a quaint figure with
his broad, ungainly shoulders supporting his rather pumpkin
face. Then his arms were a little too long and terminated
in two &#8220;leg-of-mutton&#8221; hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evenin&#8217;, Birdie,&#8221; he said bashfully. &#8220;Guess you were
sewin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess again,&#8221; cried the girl readily, her eyes dancing at
the contemplation of a few moments&#8217; badinage with a new
candidate for her favors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you wa&#8217;an&#8217;t playin&#8217; the pianner.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Birdie was quite equal to the best efforts of her
candidates.</p>
<p>&#8220;My, but ain&#8217;t you slick?&#8221; she cried, allowing her smiling
gaze to remain looking straight into his face in a way she
knew never failed to confuse her admirers on Suffering
Creek. She watched till the sturdy man&#8217;s eyes turned away,
and knew that he was groping for an adequate retort. This
effect was the result of practice with her, a practice she
thoroughly enjoyed.</p>
<p>The &#8220;leg-of-mutton&#8221; hands fumbled their way into the
tops of Toby&#8217;s trousers, and, with a sudden self-assertion,
which fitted him badly, he lurched over to the table, beyond
which Birdie was standing. It was his intention to seat
himself thereon, but his tormentor had not yet reached the
point where she could allow such intimacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, I ain&#8217;t ast you to sit around,&#8221; she said, with an
alluring pout. &#8220;Men-folk don&#8217;t sit around in a lady&#8217;s&#8217;
parlor till they&#8217;re ast. &#8217;Sides, the table&#8217;s fixed fer breakfast.
And anyway it ain&#8217;t for settin&#8217; on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toby moved away quickly, his attempt at ease deserting
him with ludicrous suddenness. At sight of his blushing
face Birdie relaxed her austerity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, ain&#8217;t you soft?&#8221; she declared, with a demure
lowering of her lids. &#8220;I&#8217;ve allus heerd say, you only got
to tell a feller don&#8217;t, an&#8217; he sure does it quick. Men-folk is
that contrary. Now&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The encouragement brought its reward. Toby promptly
sat himself on the table and set it creaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I do declare!&#8221; cried Birdie, in pretended indignation.
&#8220;And I never ast you, neither. I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m
sure. Some folks has nerve.&#8221;</p>
<p>But this time Toby was not to be intimidated. Perhaps
it was the girl&#8217;s bright smile. Perhaps, with marvelous
inspiration, he saw through her flirtatious methods. Anyway,
he remained where he was, grinning sheepishly up into
her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you best push me off. I ain&#8217;t heavy,&#8221; he dared
her clumsily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure wouldn&#8217;t demean myself that way,&#8221; she retorted.
&#8220;Gee, me settin&#8217; hands on a feller like you. It would need
a prize-fighter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The acknowledgment of his size and strength was a subtle
tribute which pleased the man, as it was intended to. He
preened himself and drew his knees up into his arms, in
an attitude intended to be one of perfect ease and to show
his confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure ain&#8217;t much of a feller for strength,&#8221; he said
modestly, eyeing his enormous arms and hands affectionately.
&#8220;You ought to see Wild Bill. He&ndash;&ndash;he could eat
me, an&#8217; never worry his digestion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Birdie laughed happily. She was always ready to laugh
at a man&#8217;s attempt at humor. That was her way.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a queer one,&#8221; she said, seating herself on the
opposite edge of the table, so that she was sufficiently adjacent,
and at the requisite angle at which to carry on her
flirtation satisfactorily. &#8220;Say,&#8221; she went on, with a down
drooping of her eyelids, &#8220;why ain&#8217;t you in there playin&#8217;
poker? Guess you&#8217;re missin&#8217; heaps o&#8217; fun. I wish I was
a &#8216;boy.&#8217; I wouldn&#8217;t miss such fun by sitting around in
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221; Toby grinned, while his brains
struggled to find a happy reply. &#8220;Well, you see,&#8221; he
hazarded at last, &#8220;poker an&#8217; whisky ain&#8217;t to be compared to
talkin&#8217; to a dandy fine gal with yaller hair an&#8217; elegant blue
eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He passed one of his great hands across his forehead as
though his attempt had made him perspire. But he had his
reward. Birdie contrived a blush of pleasure, and edged a
little nearer to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, you can talk pretty,&#8221; she declared, her lips parted
in an admiring smile. &#8220;It makes me kind o&#8217; wonder how
you fellers learn it.&#8221; Then she added demurely, &#8220;But I
ain&#8217;t pretty, nor nothing like you fellers try to make out.
I&#8217;m jest an ord&#8217;nary sort of girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No you ain&#8217;t,&#8221; broke in Toby, feeling that his initial
success had put him on the top of the situation, and that he
had nothing now to fear. Besides, he really felt that Birdie
was an uncommonly nice girl, and, in a vague way, wondered
he had never noticed it before.</p>
<p>&#8220;That you ain&#8217;t,&#8221; he went on emphatically. Then he
added as though to clinch his statement, &#8220;not by a sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>This brought him to a sudden and uncomfortable stop.
He knew he ought to go on piling up compliment on compliment
to make good his point. But he had emptied his
brain cells by his threefold denial, and now found himself
groping in something which was little better than a vacuum.
And in his trouble he found himself wishing he was gifted
with Sunny&#8217;s wit. Wild Bill&#8217;s force would have carried him
through, or even Sandy Joyce&#8217;s overweening confidence
would have kept his head above water. As it was he was
stuck. Hopelessly, irretrievably at the end of his resources.</p>
<p>He perspired in reality now, and let his knees drop out of
his arms. This movement was his salvation. With the
relaxing of his physical effort the restraining grip upon
his thinking powers gave way. Inspiration leaped, and he
found himself talking again almost before he was aware
of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a real pretty gal, Birdie,&#8221; he heard himself saying.
&#8220;Now, maybe you got some kids?&#8221; he added, with an
automatic grin of ingratiation.</p>
<p>How the inquiry slipped out he never knew. How it had
been formulated in his brain remained a riddle that he was
never able to solve. But there it was, plain and decided.
There was no shirking it. It was out in all its naked
crudeness.</p>
<p>There was a moment&#8217;s pause which might have been
hours, it seemed so horribly long to the waiting man. He
became dimly aware of a sudden hardening in Birdie&#8217;s eyes,
a mounting flush to her cheeks and forehead, a sudden, astounding
physical movement, and then the work-worn palm
of her hand came into contact with his cheek with such
force as to prove the value to her physical development of
the strenuous labors which were hers.</p>
<p>He never thought a woman&#8217;s hand could sting so much.
He never thought that he could be made to feel so mean as
this girl&#8217;s sudden vehemence made him feel.</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you, you bumming remittance feller?&#8221; she
cried, with eyes blazing and bosom heaving. &#8220;How dare
you&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; And then she further punished him
with that worst of all feminine punishments&ndash;&ndash;she burst
into tears.</p>
<p>The next few moments were never quite clear to the distracted
and unthinking Toby. He never really knew what
actually happened. He had a confused memory of saying
things by way of apology, of making several pacific overtures,
which met with physical rebuffs of no mean order,
and tearful upbraidings which were so mixed up with choking
sniffs as to be fortunately more or less unintelligible.
Finally, when he came to his ordinary senses, and the dead
level of his understanding was fully restored, he found himself
grasping the girl firmly by the waist, her golden head
lying snugly on his massive shoulder, and with a distinct
recollection of warm ripe lips many times pressed upon his
own. All of which was eminently pleasing.</p>
<p>When once these comfortable relations were thoroughly
established, he had no difficulty in clearing the clouds from
her horizon, and relegating her tears into the background.
Her nature was of a much too smiling order to need a great
deal of coaxing. But explanation was needed, and explanation
never came easily to this stalwart dullard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Y&#8217;see, what I meant was,&#8221; he said, with a troubled frown
of intense concentration, &#8220;maybe you know about kids. I
didn&#8217;t mean offense, I sure didn&#8217;t. Everybody knows our
Birdie to be jest a straight, up-standin&#8217;, proper gal, who
wouldn&#8217;t hurt nobody, nor nuthin&#8217;, &#8217;cep&#8217; it was a buzzin&#8217;
fly around the supper hash. No feller don&#8217;t take no account
o&#8217; her bein&#8217; a pot-wallopin&#8217;, hash-slingin&#8217; mutton rustler. It
sure ain&#8217;t no worse than ladlin&#8217; swill to prize hogs. It&#8217;s jest
in the way o&#8217; business. &#8217;Sides, she don&#8217;t need to care what
no fellers thinks. She ain&#8217;t stuck on men-folk wuth a cent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I sure ain&#8217;t,&#8221; asserted a smothered voice from the
bosom of his dirty shirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;That you ain&#8217;t,&#8221; he reassured her. &#8220;You&#8217;re jest a
dandy gal as &#8217;ud make any feller with a good patch o&#8217; pay
dirt a real elegant sort o&#8217; wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>The golden head snuggled closer into his shirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t got no patch o&#8217; pay dirt, Toby?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>Toby shook his head all unsuspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;No sech luck,&#8221; he asserted. Then with a sudden burst
of gallantry, &#8220;If I had I don&#8217;t guess there&#8217;d be no Birdie
Mason chasin&#8217; around these parts unbespoke.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes developed an almost childish simplicity as
they looked up into his foolish face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mean? Why, jest nothin&#8217;, only&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Toby laughed uneasily. And a shadow crossed Birdie&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t guess the patch o&#8217; pay dirt matters a heap,&#8221; she
said, with subtle encouragement.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; agreed Toby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Y&#8217;see, a gal don&#8217;t marry a feller fer his patch o&#8217; pay
dirt,&#8221; she went on, doing her best.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure she don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Toby&#8217;s enthusiasm was rapidly cooling. The girl
breathed a sigh of perfect content. And her heavy breathing
was fast making a moist patch amidst the gravel stains
on his shirt front.</p>
<p>&#8220;She jest loves a feller&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Toby&#8217;s arm slipped from her waist, and a hunted look
crept into his foolish eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; she don&#8217;t care nothin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The man was suddenly seized with a racking fit of
coughing, which somehow jolted the girl into an upright
position.</p>
<p>&#8220;Course she don&#8217;t,&#8221; he agreed, when his paroxysm had
passed. &#8220;Say, you don&#8217;t think I got newmony?&#8221; he inquired,
feeling the need for an abrupt change of subject.
&#8220;I was allus weak-chested as a kid. An&#8217; talkin&#8217; o&#8217; kids,&#8221;
he hurried on, in his terror recalling the object of his visit,
&#8220;guess you ken put me wise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kids? I wasn&#8217;t talkin&#8217; of kids,&#8221; protested the girl a
little angrily.</p>
<p>She was hurt. Cruelly hurt. All her best efforts had
gone for nothing. A moment before Toby had seemed so
nearly hers, and now&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I didn&#8217;t guess you were. But&ndash;&ndash;that is&ndash;&ndash;you
see&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The man floundered heavily and broke off. His look was
one of comical confusion and trouble. So much so that it
was too much for the girl&#8217;s good nature.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose kids?&#8221; she demanded, the familiar smile creeping
back into her eyes, and her lips pursing dryly. &#8220;Yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; denied the man quickly. &#8220;Not mine. It&#8217;s
Zip&#8217;s. Y&#8217;see, since his wife&#8217;s lit out he&#8217;s kind o&#8217; left with
&#8217;em. An&#8217; he&#8217;s that fool-headed he don&#8217;t know how to raise
&#8217;em proper. So I guessed I&#8217;d help him. Now, if you put
me wise&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You help raise Zip&#8217;s kids? Gee!&#8221; The girl slid off
the table and stood eyeing him, her woman&#8217;s humor tickled
to the limit.</p>
<p>But Toby did not realize it. He was in deadly earnest
now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said simply. Then, with a gleam of intelligence,
&#8220;How&#8217;d you raise &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl was suddenly stirred to a feeling of good-humored
malice.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d I raise &#8217;em? Why, it ain&#8217;t jest easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It sure ain&#8217;t,&#8221; agreed Toby heartily. &#8220;Now, how&#8217;d
you feed &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>Birdie became judicially wise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she began, &#8220;you can&#8217;t jest feed &#8217;em same as
ord&#8217;nary folks. They need speshul food. You&#8217;ll need to
give &#8217;em boiled milk plain or with pap, you kin git fancy
crackers an&#8217; soak &#8217;em. Then ther&#8217;s beef-tea. Not jest
ord&#8217;nary beef-tea. You want to take a boilin&#8217; o&#8217; bones, an&#8217;
boil for three hours, an&#8217; then skim well. After that you
might let it cool some, an&#8217; then you add flavorin&#8217;. Not
too much, an&#8217; not too little, jest so&#8217;s to make it elegant
tastin&#8217;. Then you cook toasties to go with it, or give &#8217;em
crackers. Serve it to &#8217;em hot, an&#8217; jest set around blowin&#8217; it
so it don&#8217;t scald their little stummicks. Got that? You
can give &#8217;em eggs, but not too much meat. Meat well done
an&#8217; cut up wi&#8217; vegetables an&#8217; gravy, an&#8217; make &#8217;em eat it with
a spoon. Knives is apt to cut &#8217;em. Eggs light boiled, an&#8217;
don&#8217;t let &#8217;em rub the yolk in their hair, nor slop gravy over
their bow-ties. Candy, some, but it ain&#8217;t good for their
teeth, which needs seein&#8217; to by a dentist, anyway. Say,
if they&#8217;re cuttin&#8217; teeth you ken let &#8217;em chew the beef bones,
it helps &#8217;em thro&#8217;. Fancy canned truck ain&#8217;t good &#8217;less it&#8217;s
baked beans, though I &#8217;lows beans cooked reg&#8217;lar is best.
You soak &#8217;em twenty-four hours, an&#8217; boil &#8217;em soft, an&#8217; see
the water don&#8217;t boil away. Fruit is good if they ain&#8217;t subjec&#8217;
to colic, which needs poultices o&#8217; linseed, an&#8217; truck like
that. Don&#8217;t let &#8217;em eat till they&#8217;re blown up like frogs, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;you
got all that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-es,&#8221; replied the bewildered man a little helplessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued the smiling girl, &#8220;then there&#8217;s their
manners an&#8217; things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toby nodded vaguely.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll need to give &#8217;em bed at sundown,&#8221; Birdie hurried
on. &#8220;An&#8217; up at sunrise. Clothes needs washin&#8217; at least
once a month&ndash;&ndash;with soap. See they says their prayers,
an&#8217; bath &#8217;em once a week reg&#8217;lar&ndash;&ndash;with soap. But do it
Sundays. An&#8217; after that give &#8217;em a Bible talk for an hour.
Then I dessay they&#8217;ll need physic once a week&ndash;&ndash;best give
it Saturday nights. Don&#8217;t fix &#8217;em that way same as a
horse, their stummicks ain&#8217;t made of leather. You got all
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Toby gave a bewildered nod.</p>
<p>&#8220;How &#8217;bout when they&#8217;re sick?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sick? Why, see they don&#8217;t muss their clothes,&#8221; Birdie
answered cheerfully. &#8220;Guess that&#8217;s put you wise to most
everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221; Toby slid from the table, feeling dazed. Nor
had he the courage to ask any more questions. He was
trying hard to fix the salient points of the information in his
whirling brain, but all he could remember was that all washing
must be done with soap, and the children must have
bones to keep their teeth right. He clung to these things
desperately, and felt that he must get away quickly before
they, too, should slip through the sieve of his memory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll git along an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; see to things,&#8221; he murmured
vaguely, without glancing in Birdie&#8217;s direction.
&#8220;You said beef bones?&#8221; he added, passing a hand perplexedly
across his forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; smiled the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. Thanks.&#8221; Then he moved heavily off. &#8220;Beef
bones and soap&ndash;&ndash;bath an&#8217; Bible talk; beef bones an&#8217;
soap&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl watched him vanish behind the closing door,
muttering as he went to &#8220;see to things.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood for some moments where he had left her. The
smile was still in her eyes, but its humor had died out. She
was unfeignedly sorry he had gone. He was such a good-natured
simpleton, she thought. A real good-hearted sort.
Just the sort to make a husband worth having. Ah, well,
he had gone! Better luck next time.</p>
<p>She turned away with a deep, sentimental sigh, and
crossed over to the cupboard. She drew out her work once
more and again spread out the crumpled paper pattern upon
the gossamer lawn.</p>
<p>Yes, Toby would have suited her well. She heaved another
sigh. He had remittances from home, too. And he
wouldn&#8217;t be difficult to manage. His head was rather a
funny shape, and his face didn&#8217;t suggest brightness, but
then&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>She began to snip at the material with her rusty scissors.
But just as her mind had fully concentrated upon her task
a sudden sound startled her. She looked up, listening, and
the next moment the door was flung wide, and Sandy Joyce
stood framed in the opening.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>BIRDIE GIVES MORE ADVICE</h3>
</div>
<p>The ordinary woman would probably have resented this
second interruption, taking into consideration the nature of
Birdie&#8217;s occupation, and the fact that Toby&#8217;s visit had hardly
proved a success from her point of view. But Birdie was
only partially ordinary. Her love and admiration for the
opposite sex was so much the chief part of her composition
that all other considerations gave way before it. Her heart
thrilled with a sickly sentiment at all times. To her men
were the gods of the universe, and, as such, must be propitiated,
at least in theory. In practice it might be necessary to
flout them, to tease them, even to snub them&ndash;&ndash;on rare occasions.
But this would only come after intimacy had been
established. After that her attitude would be governed by
circumstances, and even then her snubs, her floutings, her
teasing, would only be done as a further lure, a further propitiation.
She loved them all with a wonderful devotion.
Her heart was large, so large that the whole race of men
could have been easily lost in its mysterious and obscure recesses.</p>
<p>Again her work was bundled into the cupboard, the poor
flimsy pattern further suffering. But beyond a casual wonder
if the garment would eventually be wearable, cut from
so mangled a pattern, she had no real care.</p>
<p>Her smiling eyes turned readily upon the newcomer the
moment her secret labors had been hidden from prying male
eyes. And there was no mistaking her cordiality for this
cold-eyed visitor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sakes alive! but you do look fierce,&#8221; she cried challengingly.
&#8220;You sure must be in a bad temper.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Sandy&#8217;s expression was simply the outcome of long
and difficult consideration. As a matter of fact, in his hard
way, he was feeling very delighted. His past married
experience had brought him to the conviction that here was
the only person in Suffering Creek who could help him.</p>
<p>And, furthermore, he was well satisfied to think that only
his experience as a married man could have suggested to
him this means of gaining the information required by their
president, and so shown him the way to surpass his comrades
in his efforts on behalf of the Trust.</p>
<p>But his knowledge of womankind warned him that he
must not be too hasty. He must not show his hand until he
had established himself in a favorable position in the susceptible
Birdie&#8217;s heart. With this object in view he set himself
to offer his blandishments in characteristic fashion. He
did not suffer from Toby&#8217;s complaint of bashfulness. Married
life had cured him of that. In consequence, his
method, if crude, was direct.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say the same of you, Birdie,&#8221; he declared unsmilingly.
&#8220;You&#8217;re bloomin&#8217; as&ndash;&ndash;as a kebbige.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kebbige?&#8221; sniffed the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kebbige, sure,&#8221; nodded the man of married experience.
&#8220;Guess mebbe it ain&#8217;t a bokay fer smell. But fer taste&ndash;&ndash;with
corned beef? Gee!&#8221;</p>
<p>Birdie took no umbrage.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got to it&ndash;&ndash;after awhiles,&#8221; she remarked slyly.
Then she added, with a gush, &#8220;D&#8217;you know, I&#8217;m allus most
scared to death of you men. You&#8217;re that big an&#8217; strong, it
makes me feel you could well-nigh eat me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy availed himself of the invitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;A tasty mouthful,&#8221; he declared. And without more ado
he passed round the table, caught her quickly in his arms,
and, without the smallest expression of interest, kissed her.
If interest were lacking, his movements were so swift that,
had the girl the least idea of avoiding the embrace&ndash;&ndash;which
she hadn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;she would have found it difficult to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;You men are ones!&#8221; she declared, with a little gasp, as
his arms fell from about her.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never did&ndash;&ndash;the cheek of some of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A feller needs cheek,&#8221; replied the self-satisfied widower.
&#8220;&#8217;Specially with pretty gals around,&#8221; he added condescendingly.</p>
<p>Birdie eyed him archly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gals?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have said &#8216;gal.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>The laughing nod that rewarded him assured Sandy that
he was well on the right track, and at once he took the opportunity
of introducing the object of his visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he began, &#8220;guess you never tho&#8217;t o&#8217; gettin&#8217; hitched
up to a feller?&#8221;</p>
<p>Birdie lowered her eyelids and struggled for a blush, which
somehow defied her best efforts. But her subtleties were
quite lost upon Sandy, and in his eagerness he waited for no
reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, course you hain&#8217;t. You got so many beaus to
choose from. &#8217;Sides,&#8221; he added thoughtfully, &#8220;gettin&#8217; married
sure needs special savvee. What I mean,&#8221; he explained,
seeing the amused wonder in the girl&#8217;s now wide
eyes, &#8220;you kind o&#8217; need eddicatin&#8217; to git married. Y&#8217;see,
when you get fixed that way you sort of, in a manner of
speakin&#8217;, got to unlearn things you never learnt, an&#8217; learn
them things what can&#8217;t never be taught. What I mean is,
marriage is a sort of eddication of itself, wot don&#8217;t learn you
nuthin&#8217; till you git&ndash;&ndash;unmarried. Savee?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl shook her head in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s sure too bright fer me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s &#8217;cos you ain&#8217;t been married. Y&#8217;see, I have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you put it easier&ndash;&ndash;seein&#8217; I ain&#8217;t been married?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I can.&#8221; Sandy took up a position, on the edge of
the table with such a judicial air that the girl started to
giggle.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; he began largely. &#8220;Now what d&#8217;you know
&#8217;bout kids&ndash;&ndash;raisin&#8217; &#8217;em, I mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes twinkled on the verge of laughing outright.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zip&#8217;s kids?&#8221; she inquired shrewdly.</p>
<p>Sandy started and frowned.</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;you mean&ndash;&ndash;Zip&#8217;s kids?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just nothing,&#8221; said Birdie airily. &#8220;Seein&#8217; kids was
in your mind, I naturally tho&#8217;t o&#8217; Zip&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy nodded. But he was only half convinced. How
on earth, he wondered, did she know he was thinking of
Zip&#8217;s kids? He felt that it would be best to nip that idea in
the bud. It was undignified that he should appear to be
interested in Zip&#8217;s twins.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t interested in no special kids,&#8221; he said, with some
dignity. &#8220;I was just theorizin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;like. Now, if you got
married, wot you know of raisin&#8217; kids? Guess you&#8217;re that
ignorant of the subject maybe you&#8217;d feed &#8217;em hay?&#8221;</p>
<p>Birdie laughed dutifully, but her retort was rather disconcerting.</p>
<p>&#8220;You bin married&ndash;&ndash;how&#8217;d you feed &#8217;em? I&#8217;m learning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d I feed &#8217;em?&#8221; Sandy eyed his tormentor severely.
&#8220;That ain&#8217;t the question. How&#8217;d you feed &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl thought for a moment, and then looked up
brightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they was Zip&#8217;s kids&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said they ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if they were, I&#8217;d say&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, cut Zip&#8217;s kids out. They ain&#8217;t in this shootin&#8217;
match,&#8221; cried Sandy testily.</p>
<p>But Birdie persisted slyly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Y&#8217;see, I must get some kids in my eye if I&#8217;m to answer
you right,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I can see things better that way.
Now, if they were Zip&#8217;s kids&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which they ain&#8217;t,&#8221; asseverated the man doggedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which they ain&#8217;t,&#8221; nodded Birdie, &#8220;I&#8217;d feed &#8217;em cereals
an&#8217; pap&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy&#8217;s face suddenly cleared. His whole being seemed
to expand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you&#8217;re a bright gal,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Cereals an&#8217;
pap. That&#8217;s dead right. Say, you know more than&ndash;&ndash;You&#8217;d
give &#8217;em milk to drink&ndash;&ndash;now?&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, nothing like that. Water.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man looked disappointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Water?&#8221; he said. &#8220;You sure of that? But I guess
you&#8217;d give &#8217;em banannys?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the girl shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fruit gives &#8217;em colic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, that&#8217;s so. They&#8217;d need physic then, wouldn&#8217;t
they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You need to be easy with physic, too,&#8221; declared the girl,
with sparkling eyes. &#8220;Don&#8217;t give &#8217;em physic ever unless
they&#8217;re real sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s crestfallen appearance set Birdie giggling. She
was enjoying the situation. She meant to upset all Sandy&#8217;s
preconceived ideas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, pork?&#8221; he suggested, but with less assurance.</p>
<p>But Birdie was obdurate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; she declared emphatically. &#8220;Beans, yes.
There&#8217;s good nourishment in beans. Then ther&#8217;s fresh vegetables&ndash;&ndash;heaps
of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Now, how &#8217;bout fixin&#8217; them right&ndash;&ndash;the kids, I
mean? Guess they&#8217;ll need bathin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Birdie fell upon him with a strong denial.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bath?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Gee! you do run on. Guess you
want to hand &#8217;em newmony. Kids sure don&#8217;t never need
bathin&#8217;. Jest a lick with soap an&#8217; hot water once a week.
An&#8217; say,&#8221; she went on, suddenly remembering something
she had told Toby in a fit of mischief, &#8220;kep their food soft,
or you&#8217;ll break their young teeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy&#8217;s eyes lit, and in an unguarded moment he admitted
that the thought had occurred to him. Birdie caught him
up at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tho&#8217;t you was just astin&#8217; me these questions to see if I
was right for gettin&#8217; married?&#8221; she protested innocently.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so&ndash;&ndash;course,&#8221; he said hastily. Then he wriggled
out of it. &#8220;But how&#8217;d I be able to say you was right if I
hadn&#8217;t tho&#8217;t on things some myself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! I didn&#8217;t just think of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Course not. Gals never see the fine points of good
argyment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy&#8217;s superiority was overwhelming, but Birdie had
borne with him with amused patience until now. She
had known him a long time as a boarder, but never until now
had she realized the blundering conceit that was his. She
felt that she had given him rope enough, and it was time to
bring him up with a jerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you kindly, sir,&#8221; she mocked him, curtseying.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; Sandy returned, with a
clumsy bow, failing to realize her change of attitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you guess I&#8217;m right for marryin&#8217;, maybe you&#8217;ll hand
me my diploma,&#8221; she said, with a demure down-drooping of
her eyelids.</p>
<p>She waited, and finally glanced up into his flushed face.
Her sarcasm had struck home at last, and without hesitation
she went on mercilessly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, if you ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to hand me a diploma, guess you
can let me get on with my sewin&#8217;. Havin&#8217; been a married
man, maybe you&#8217;ll understand men-folk ain&#8217;t a heap of use
around when a woman&#8217;s sewin&#8217;. Guess they&#8217;re handy ladlin&#8217;
out most things, but I&#8217;d say a man ain&#8217;t no more use round
the eye of a needle than a camel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy&#8217;s dignity and temper were ruffled. It was inconceivable
that Birdie&ndash;&ndash;or, as he mentally apostrophized her,
&#8220;this blamed hash-slinger&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;should so flout him. How
dared she? He was so angry that words for once utterly
failed him, and he moved towards the door with gills as scarlet
as any blustering turkey-cock. But Birdie had no idea
of sparing him, and hurled her final sarcasm as she turned
again to her cupboard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d hate to be one o&#8217; Zip&#8217;s kids with you gettin&#8217; busy
around me,&#8221; she cried, chuckling in an infuriating manner.</p>
<p>It was too much for Sandy. He turned fiercely as he
reached the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re &#8216;bug,&#8217;&#8221; he declared roughly. &#8220;I tell you, Zip&#8217;s
kids ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; to do with me&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which, I&#8217;d say, was lucky for them,&#8221; cried Birdie airily.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;d jest like to say that when a genelman gits around
to do the perlite by a no-account mutton-worrier, he figgers
to be treat right&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Birdie turned on him with cold eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll sure be treatin&#8217; you right,&#8221; she said, &#8220;when I tell you
that door don&#8217;t need shuttin&#8217; after you. It&#8217;s on the swing.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not wait to witness her guest&#8217;s departure. She
felt it would not be graceful, under the circumstances. So,
pushing her head into the cupboard, she once more gathered
up her work.</p>
<p>When the soft swish of the swing-door told her that
Sandy&#8217;s departure had been taken, she emerged with her
bundle and spread it out on the table for the third time.
She was all smiles. She was not a bit angry with the foolish
widower. This dogmatic attitude of mind, this wonderful
self-satisfaction, were peculiar to the creature; he couldn&#8217;t
help it. But it had roused a mischievous spirit in her, and
the temptation was too great to resist. The only thing she
regretted was having let him kiss her, and she at once put
up her hand to wipe the spot where the operation had been
performed. At any rate, she had certainly taken him
down a peg or two, and the thought set her in high good-humor.</p>
<p>Nor could she help wondering at his stupidity in imagining
she couldn&#8217;t see through his desire for information about
children. It was laughable, coming after Toby&#8217;s. Oh, these
men! They were dear, foolish creatures. Poor kids, she
thought, her mind reverting to Zip&#8217;s twins. What had they
done to have this pack of foolish people worrying over
them? Were they all going to take a hand in bringing the
youngsters up? Well, anyhow, she pitied them.</p>
<p>She smiled at her thoughts as the busy scissors snipped
their way round the pattern. These men were too funny.
First Toby, now Sandy&ndash;&ndash;who next?</p>
<p>She started and looked up, her scissors poised in the air.
The swing-door had swished open, and Wild Bill stood before
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good sakes!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;How you scared me!&#8221;
Then, realizing what lay before her, she grabbed up her
work, and was for returning it to the cupboard.</p>
<p>But Wild Bill was in a hurry. Besides, he had nothing of
the ingratiating ways of the other men about him. He saw
her object, and stayed her in his own peculiar authoritative
fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you can quit huggin&#8217; them fixin&#8217;s,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I
ain&#8217;t come pryin&#8217; around a leddy&#8217;s wardrobe. You ken jest
set down with paper an&#8217; ink an&#8217; things, an&#8217; write down how
best Zip&#8217;s kids can be raised. I&#8217;ll git right back for it in
ha&#8217;f-an-hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nor did he wait for any reply. It was taken for granted
that his demands would be promptly acceded to, and he
vanished as abruptly as he came. The swing-door closed,
and Birdie gave a sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; him, too,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;Well, I do declare. It
just licks creation.&#8221;</p>
<p>But this was a different proposition to either Toby or
Sandy. She sprang to her task for the great Wild Bill in a
way that spoke volumes for her sentimental heart. Wild
Bill? Well, she would never have owned it, but there was
just one man in the world that scared Birdie to death, and at
the same time made her think her path was a bed of roses,
and that was Wild Bill. In an astonishingly short time she
was sitting at the table poring over a writing-pad, and biting
the already well-chewed end of a pen.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Outside, in the smoke-laden atmosphere of the store,
amidst the busy click of poker chips and clink of glasses,
Wild Bill was talking earnestly to Minky, who was standing
behind the counter.</p>
<p>They had been talking for some time. Minky&#8217;s eyes frequently
wandered in the direction of a table where four
strangers were playing. But no one could have guessed, in
his quiet scrutiny, the anxiety that lay behind it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>must</i> git out to-night?&#8221; he inquired of his hawk-visaged
friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; responded Bill absently.</p>
<p>&#8220;High finance?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill nodded, with the ghost of a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;A gang of rich guys,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re gathering at
Spawn City for a financial descent on Suffering Creek.
They&#8217;re all minin&#8217; folk. Guess they&#8217;ll be yearning for a big
game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When&#8217;ll you git back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Noon, day after to-morrow, maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill had turned away, and was abstractedly contemplating
the strangers. Suddenly he turned again, and his steely eyes
fixed themselves on the troubled Minky.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, things is gettin&#8217; on your nerves. It ain&#8217;t yet.
Those folks is only lookin&#8217; fer pointers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; findin&#8217; &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe. But it takes time. Say, we ain&#8217;t dead in Suffering
Creek yet. I&#8217;ll be around before&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trouble gits busy.&#8221; Minky laughed hollowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. I&#8217;m most gener&#8217;ly around when trouble&ndash;&ndash;gits
busy. I&#8217;m made like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill drank up the remains of his drink and began to move
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wher&#8217; you going now?&#8221; inquired Minky.</p>
<p>&#8220;See my plugs fed an&#8217; watered, and then gittin&#8217; around
my shack. I&#8217;ve got to see some folks before I hit the trail.
Say, I ain&#8217;t got big enough wad. Best hand me a couple o&#8217;
thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minky dived under his counter, and, after fumbling for
some time, reappeared with the required sum in United
States currency.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good luck,&#8221; he said, as he passed it across the counter
cautiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks. An&#8217;, say&ndash;&ndash;see the boys keep a close eye on
Zip&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; the kids. So long.&#8221;</p>
<p>He moved away, but instead of passing out of the front
door he disappeared into the dining-room at the back.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE TRUST AT WORK</h3>
</div>
<p>Wild Bill&#8217;s hut presented an unusually animated appearance.
The customary oil-lamp was receiving the support
of two vilely smelling yellow candles. The additional light
thus obtained was hardly in proportion to the offensiveness
of the added aroma. Still, the remoter corners of the place
were further lit up, and the rough faces of the four occupants
of the room were thrown into stronger relief.</p>
<p>But the animation of the scene was rather a matter of
visual illusion than actuality. For Wild Bill, in his right
of proprietorship, was lounging on his blanketed bunk, while
Toby&#8217;s inanimate form robbed him of the extreme foot of
it. Sunny Oak was hugging to himself what comfort there
was to be obtained from the broken chair, which usually
supported Bill&#8217;s wash bucket, set well within elbow-reach
of the table on which the illuminations had been placed.
Sandy Joyce with unusual humility&ndash;&ndash;possibly the result of
his encounter with Birdie&ndash;&ndash;was crouching on an upturned
cracker box.</p>
<p>There was a wonderful intentness, expectancy in every
eye except Bill&#8217;s. In Toby&#8217;s there was triumphal anticipation,
in Sandy&#8217;s a conscious assurance. Bill had just come
in from preparing his horses for their night journey, and,
with an hour and more to spare, and the prospect of a long
night before him, was anxious to take things as easy as
possible.</p>
<p>Reaching his arms above his head he pushed his hands
behind it for support, and opened the proceedings.</p>
<p>&#8220;You fellers been busy?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>And promptly every mouth opened to give proud assurance.
But the gambler checked the impulse with grating
sarcasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t got but one pair ears,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so you&#8217;ll each
wait till you&#8217;re ast questions. Bein&#8217; president o&#8217; this yer
Trust I&#8217;ll do most of the yappin&#8217;,&#8221; he added grimly. &#8220;I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; away to-night fer a couple o&#8217; days. That&#8217;s why this
meetin&#8217;s called. An&#8217; the object of it is to fix things right
for Zip, an&#8217; to &#8217;range so he gits a chance to put &#8217;em through.
Now, I seen enough of him&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; others,&#8221; with a swift,
withering glance in Sunny&#8217;s direction, &#8220;to know he&#8217;s right
up again a proposition that ain&#8217;t no one man affair. Combination
is the only bluff to fix them kids of his right.
We&#8217;ve most of us got ideas, but like as not they ain&#8217;t all
we guess &#8217;em to be. In some cases ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t a doubt of it.
Without sayin&#8217; nothin&#8217; of anybody, I sure wouldn&#8217;t trust
Toby here to raise a crop of well-grown weeds&ndash;&ndash;without
help. An&#8217; Sandy, fer all he&#8217;s a married man, don&#8217;t seem
to have prospered in his knowledge of kids. As for Sunny,
well, the sight of him around a kid ain&#8217;t wholesome. An&#8217;
as fer me, guess I may know a deal about cookin&#8217; a jack-pot,
but I&#8217;d hate to raise the bet about any other kind o&#8217; pot.
Seein&#8217; things is that way with us we&#8217;ll git to work systematic.
Ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t a gamble in life that ain&#8217;t worked the better fer
a system. So, before we get busy, I&#8217;ll ast you, Sunny, to
grab the grip under my bunk, an&#8217; you&#8217;ll find in it, som&#8217;eres
under the card decks, paper an&#8217; ink. You&#8217;ll jest fix them
right, an&#8217; take things down, so we don&#8217;t make no sort o&#8217;
mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>He waited until Sunny had procured the necessary writing
materials and set them out on the table. Then he went on
in his strong, autocratic fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, fixing his eyes on Toby. &#8220;You&#8217;se fellers
has had time to make inquiries, an&#8217; knowing you fer
bright boys I don&#8217;t guess you lost any time. The subject is
the raisin&#8217; of kids. Mebbe Toby, you bein&#8217; the youngest
member of this doggone Trust, an&#8217; a real smart lad, mebbe
you&#8217;ll open your face an&#8217; give us pointers.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the time he finished speaking every eye was turned
on the triumphantly grinning Toby.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure will,&#8221; he said, with a confidence surprising in a
man who had been so bashful in his interview with Birdie.
Just for a moment one of his great hands went up to his
cheek, and he gently smoothed it, as though the recollection
of the slap he had received in the process of gathering information
was being used to inspire his memory. &#8220;Y&#8217;see,&#8221;
he began, &#8220;I got friends around Suffering Creek what knows
all about kids. So&ndash;&ndash;so I jest asted &#8217;em, Mr. President.&#8221;</p>
<p>He cleared his throat and stared up at the roof. He was
evidently struggling hard with memory.</p>
<p>Bill lolled over and drew a closely written document from
his pocket and began to peruse it. Sandy tapped the floor
impatiently with one foot. He was annoyed that his evidence
was not demanded first. Sunny sat with pen poised,
waiting for the word to write.</p>
<p>Toby&#8217;s eyes grew troubled.</p>
<p>&#8220;What they chiefly need,&#8221; he murmured, his face becoming
more and more intent, &#8220;what they&ndash;&ndash;chiefly&ndash;&ndash;need&ndash;&ndash;is&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
He was laboring hard. Then suddenly his face
brightened into a foolish smile. &#8220;I got it,&#8221; he cried triumphantly,
&#8220;I got it. What kids need is beef bones an&#8217; soap!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the deathly silence that followed his statement Toby
looked for approving glances. But he looked in vain.
Sunny had dropped his pen and made a blot on his paper.
Sandy&#8217;s annoyance had changed into malicious triumph.
But the president of the Trust made no move. He merely
let his small eyes emit a steely glance over the top of his
paper, directed with stern disapproval on the hopeful &#8220;remittance&#8221;
man.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; what &#8216;bug-house,&#8217;&#8221; he inquired, with biting sarcasm,
&#8220;is your bright friends spendin&#8217; their vacation at?&#8221;</p>
<p>Toby flushed to the roots of his unkempt hair. The
sudden death of his triumph was almost tragic. His face
fell, and his heavy jaw dropped in pathetic astonishment.
But it was not Bill&#8217;s sarcasm alone that so bit into his bones,
it was the jeering light he witnessed in Sandy&#8217;s eyes, combined
with the undisguised ridicule of Sunny&#8217;s open grin.
His blood began to rise; he felt it tingling in the great extremities
of his long arms. The obvious retort of the witless
was surging through his veins and driving him.</p>
<p>But the Trust president was talking, and the calm of
coming storm was held for a moment. But it is doubtful if
the object of his harangue grasped anything of his meaning,
so great was his anger against his grinning comrades.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beef bones an&#8217; soap!&#8221; cried Bill harshly, at the unheeding
man. &#8220;If they was asses bones we&#8217;d sure only need to
open up your family mausoleum to git enough bones to
raise a farm o&#8217; babbies on. I&#8217;d like to say right here, the
feller wot don&#8217;t know the natural use o&#8217; soap is a danger
to the health an&#8217; sanitary fixin&#8217;s o&#8217; this yer camp. Beef
bones an&#8217; soap!&#8221; he went on, as though the very combination
of the words was an offense to his gastronomical senses.
&#8220;You pumpkin-faced idjut, you mush-headed tank o&#8217; wisdom,
you masterpiece of under-done mule brain, how in
sizzlin&#8217; torment you&#8217;re figgerin&#8217; to ladle soap into the vitals
of inoffendin&#8217; babbies, an&#8217; push beef bones through their
innercent stummicks, &#8217;ud par&#8217;lize the brains of every science
society in this yer country to know, an&#8217; drive the whole world
o&#8217; physic dealers barkin&#8217; like a pack o&#8217; mangy coyotes wi&#8217;
their bellies flappin&#8217; in a nor&#8217;-east blizzard. Gosh-dang it,
you misfortunate offspring of Jonah parents, we&#8217;re settin&#8217;
out to raise kids. We ain&#8217;t startin&#8217; a patent manure fact&#8217;ry,
nor runnin&#8217; a Chinese hand laundry&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But the president&#8217;s picturesque flow was lost in a sudden
commotion. The calm was broken, and the storm burst.
The weight of ridicule in his comrades&#8217; faces was too much
for Toby, and he leapt from the foot of the bunk on which
he was sitting. He projected himself with more force than
cunning in the direction of the grinning loafer, bent on
bodily hurt to his victim. But his leap fell short by reason
of Sunny&#8217;s agility. The latter snatched up the oil-lamp
and dodged behind the table, with the result that Toby&#8217;s
great body sent the candles flying, and itself fell amidst the
legs of the upset table. He was on his feet in an instant,
however, ready to continue with all his might his vengeful
pursuit. But the heavy hand of Bill fell upon his coat collar
with irresistible force, and, with a jerk, he was hurled across
the room out of harm&#8217;s way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217;s more hell to the back o&#8217; that if you come ag&#8217;in,
Toby,&#8221; the gambler cried, with cold threat. &#8220;An&#8217; as for
you, Sunny,&#8221; he went on, turning on the Trust secretary,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll set the boys to wash you clean in Minky&#8217;s trough if
you so much as smile ag&#8217;in till we&#8217;re through. Fix them
candles, an&#8217; sit right down&ndash;&ndash;the lot of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood for a moment eyeing the lurid face of Toby.
Nor did he move until the burly remittance man had pulled
himself together. He watched him settle himself again on
the foot of the bunk, passive but inwardly raging. Then,
as the candles were once more replaced in the bottles and
lit, he calmly picked up his document and returned to his
couch. The whole episode passed in a few moments, and
outward equanimity was quickly restored. Such was the
hot, impulsive nature of these men.</p>
<p>The president lost no time in proceeding with the business
in hand. He addressed his friends generally.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to say a word &#8217;bout the elegant information
gathered by our bright junior member,&#8221; he said slowly.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve all heard it, an&#8217; I guess that&#8217;s sure all that&#8217;s needed.
Wher&#8217; he got it, is his funeral&ndash;&ndash;or should be. Leastways,
if it ain&#8217;t satisfact&#8217;ry it shows laudable enterprise on his part&ndash;&ndash;which
is good for this yer Trust.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and referred to his document. And in that
moment, burning to further crush Toby, and add to his own
glorification by reason of the superiority of his information,
Sandy cleared his throat to speak. This was to be the moment
of his triumph. He meant to wipe out the memory
of past failures in one sweep.</p>
<p>&#8220;I consulted a lady friend of mine&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he began. But
Bill waved him to silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t worry nothin&#8217;,&#8221; he said coldly. &#8220;I got it
all wrote down here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How you got it?&#8221; cried Sandy. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t said it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill&#8217;s eyes met the other&#8217;s angry glance with that cold
irony that was so much a part of his nature.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess your leddy friend wrote it,&#8221; he said. And, as he
heard the words, the last of Toby&#8217;s ill-humor vanished. His
stupid face wreathed itself into a broad grin as he watched
the blank look of disappointment spread itself over Sandy&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen here, all of you,&#8221; the president went on, quite
undisturbed by the feelings he had stirred in the widower.
&#8220;This is wot the leddy says. She&#8217;s writ it all so ther&#8217; can&#8217;t
be no mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he began to read from his document with careful
distinctness.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t take no notice of what I told Toby Jenks an&#8217;
Sandy Joyce. I jest fooled &#8217;em proper. Toby&#8217;s a nice boy,
but he ain&#8217;t got brains enough to kep himself warm on a
summer day, so I didn&#8217;t waste nothin&#8217; on him, &#8217;cep&#8217; time.
As fer Sandy, he&#8217;s sech a con-se-quenshul&ndash;&ndash;&#8217; Have I
got that word right, Sunny?&#8221; Bill inquired blandly of the
secretary.</p>
<p>&#8220;You sure have,&#8221; grinned Sunny, enjoying himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Sech a consequenshul fool of an idjut man,&#8217;&#8221; Bill read
on, with a glance into Sandy&#8217;s scarlet face, &#8220;&#8216;that I hadn&#8217;t
no time but to push him out of this dinin&#8217;-room.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The miser&#8217;ble hash-slinger,&#8221; exploded the exasperated
Sandy, springing to his feet, his eyes blazing with impotent
fury.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; commanded the president. &#8220;This yere is a
proper meetin&#8217; of the Zip Trust, an&#8217; don&#8217;t call fer no langwidge
ag&#8217;in a defenseless woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then she ain&#8217;t no right to say things,&#8221; cried the outraged
man.</p>
<p>&#8220;She ain&#8217;t. She&#8217;s wrote &#8217;em,&#8221; retorted Bill, in a manner
that left nothing more to be said. &#8220;&#8216;Consequenshul,&#8217; was
the word,&#8221; he went on, rolling it off his tongue as though
he enjoyed its flavor, &#8220;an&#8217; I allow it must have took her
thinking some to be so elegant. You&#8217;ll set,&#8221; he added,
glancing up severely at the still standing man.</p>
<p>Sandy dropped back on his box, but he was anything but
appeased. His dignity was hurt sorely. He, who understood
women so well, to be treated like this. Then he tried
to console himself with the opinion that after all Birdie was
not exactly a woman, only a &#8220;pot-rustler.&#8221; But Bill was
pushing the business forward. He wanted to get the matter
in hand settled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;this is how she says of them kids:
&#8216;You can&#8217;t jest lay down reg&#8217;lations fer feedin&#8217;. Jest feed
&#8217;em natural, an&#8217; if they git a pain dose &#8217;em with physic.
Ther&#8217;s some things you must kep &#8217;em from gittin&#8217; into their
stummicks. Kindlin&#8217; wood is ridiculous fer them to chew,
ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t no goodness in it, an&#8217; it&#8217;s li&#8217;ble to run slivvers into
their vitals. Sulphur matches ain&#8217;t good fer &#8217;em to suck.
I ain&#8217;t got nothing to say &#8217;bout the sulphur, but the phospherus
is sure injurious, an&#8217;, anyway, it&#8217;s easy settin&#8217; &#8217;emselves
afire. Kids is ter&#8217;ble fond of sand, an&#8217; gravel, an&#8217;
mud, inside an&#8217; out. Outside ain&#8217;t no harm, &#8217;cep&#8217; it keps you
washin&#8217; &#8217;em, but inside&#8217;s likely to give &#8217;em colic. Don&#8217;t let
&#8217;em climb on tables an&#8217; things. Ther&#8217; never was a kid who
could climb on to a table but what could fall off. Don&#8217;t
let &#8217;em lick stove-black off a hot cookstove. This don&#8217;t need
explainin&#8217; to folk of ord&#8217;nary intelligence. Coal is for
makin&#8217; a fire, an&#8217; ain&#8217;t good eatin&#8217;. Boilin&#8217; water has its
uses, but it ain&#8217;t good play fer kids. Guns an&#8217; knives ain&#8217;t
needed fer kids playin&#8217; Injun. These things is jest general
notions to kep in your head fer ord&#8217;nary guidance. Kids&#8217;
clothes needs washin&#8217; every Monday&ndash;&ndash;with soap. Mebbe
you&#8217;ll need to wash every day if kids is frolicsome. Bow-ties
is for Sunday wear. Girl&#8217;s hair needs braidin&#8217; every
night, an&#8217; don&#8217;t leave chewin&#8217; t&#8217;baccer around. Kids is sure
to eat it. Best give &#8217;em physic every Saturday night, an&#8217;
bath &#8217;em Sunday mornin&#8217;. Don&#8217;t use no hand scrubber. If
you can&#8217;t git through the dirt by ord&#8217;nary washin&#8217;, best leave
it. Kids is tender-skinned anyway. After their bath set
&#8217;em out in the sun, an&#8217; give &#8217;em an elegant Bible talk. Ther&#8217;
ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; like a Bible talk fer kids. It sets &#8217;em wise to
religion early, an&#8217; gives &#8217;em a good impression o&#8217; the folks
raisin&#8217; &#8217;em. Ef they ast too many questions you need to
answer &#8217;em with discretion&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wot&#8217;s she mean by that?&#8221; asked Toby, all interest in
the mass of detail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mean? Why&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Bill paused considering.</p>
<p>Sunny looked up from his writing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, don&#8217;t say fool things fer the sake of gassin&#8217;!&#8221; he
explained readily. &#8220;Everything you tell &#8217;em needs a moral.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Moral?&#8221; murmured Toby vaguely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, moral.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Sandy saw a chance of restoring his fallen prestige,
and promptly seized upon it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moral,&#8221; he said, beaming with self-satisfaction, &#8220;is
handin&#8217; a lesson all wrop up in fancy words so&#8217;s to set folks
cussin&#8217; like mad they can&#8217;t understand it, an&#8217; hatin&#8217; themselves
when they&#8217;re told its meanin&#8217;. Now, if I was goin&#8217;
to show you what a blamed idjut you was without jest
sayin&#8217; so&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; cried Bill. And without waiting for a reply
he read on, &#8220;&#8216;&ndash;&ndash;with discretion. If you treat kids proper
they mostly raise themselves, which is jest Natur&#8217;. Don&#8217;t
worry yourself, &#8217;less they fall into a swill-barrel, or do
some ridiculous stunt o&#8217; that natur&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; don&#8217;t worry <i>them</i>.
Ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t no sense to anybody goin&#8217; around with notions
they ken flap their wings, an&#8217; cluck like a broody hen; an&#8217;
scratchin&#8217; worms is positive ridiculous. Help &#8217;em when they
need help, otherwise let &#8217;em fall around till they knock sense
into theirselves. Jest let &#8217;em be kids as long as Natur&#8217; fancies,
so&#8217;s when they git growed up, which they&#8217;re goin&#8217; to
do anyways, they&#8217;ll likely make elegant men an&#8217; women.
Ef you set &#8217;em under glass cases they&#8217;ll sure get fixed into
things what glass cases is made to hold&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s images. I
don&#8217;t guess I kin tell you nothin&#8217; more &#8217;bout kids, seein&#8217; I
ain&#8217;t a mother, but jest a pot-wolloper.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill folded the paper as he finished reading, and silently
handed it across to the secretary. Somehow he seemed
impressed with the information the paper contained. The
whole meeting seemed impressed. Even Sandy had no
comment to offer, while Toby resorted to biting his forefinger
and gazing stupidly at the opposite wall. It was
Sunny who finally broke the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll jest writ&#8217; out the chief points fer Zip&#8217;s guidance?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>Bill nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, sure,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;Jest the chief points.
Then you&#8217;ll hand it to Zip to-morrer mornin&#8217;, an&#8217;, ef he
needs it, you can explain wot he ain&#8217;t wise to. I&#8217;d like to
say right here that this hash-slinger has got savvee. Great
big savvee, an&#8217; a heap of it. I ain&#8217;t a hell of a lot on the kid
racket, they mostly make me sick to death. In a manner o&#8217;
speakin&#8217;, I don&#8217;t care a cuss for Zip nor his kids. Ef they
drown theirselves in a swill-bar&#8217;l it&#8217;s his funeral, an&#8217; their
luck, an&#8217; it don&#8217;t cut no ice with me. But, cuss me, ef I
ken stand to see a low-down skunk like this yer James come
it over a feller-citizen o&#8217; Suffering Creek, an&#8217; it&#8217;s our duty to
see Zip gits thro&#8217;. I&#8217;m sore on James. Sore as hell. I ain&#8217;t
no Bible-thumpin&#8217;, mush-hearted, push-me-amongst-the-angels
feller anyways. An&#8217; you boys has got to git right
on to that, quick.&#8221; He glared round at his friends defiantly,
as though daring them to do otherwise. But as nobody gave
a sign of doubt on the subject, he had no alternative but to
continue. &#8220;I&#8217;m jest sore on James an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He hesitated
for the fraction of a second, but went on almost immediately.
&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;ther&#8217; may come a time when the play gits busy. Get
me? Wal,&#8221; as Sandy and Sunny nodded assent, and Toby
sat all eyes for the speaker, &#8220;this yere Trust is a goin&#8217; concern,
an&#8217;, I take it, we mean business. So, though we ain&#8217;t
runnin&#8217; a noospaper, maybe we&#8217;ll need a fightin&#8217; editor after
all. If we need a fightin&#8217; editor we&#8217;ll sure need a fightin&#8217;
staff. That&#8217;s jest logic. I&#8217;ll ast you right here, is you boys
that fightin&#8217; staff? If so, guess I&#8217;m fightin&#8217; editor. How?&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes were on Sunny Oak. And that individual&#8217;s
unwashed face broadened into a cheerful grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fightin&#8217; don&#8217;t come under the headin&#8217; of work&ndash;&ndash;proper,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Guess I&#8217;m in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill turned on Sandy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t got the modest beauty o&#8217; the vi&#8217;let,&#8221; he said,
with saturnine levity. &#8220;How you feelin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure good,&#8221; exclaimed the widower. &#8220;But I&#8217;d feel
better lettin&#8217; air into the carkis of James.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; muttered Bill. &#8220;An&#8217; you, Toby?&#8221; he went on,
turning on the &#8220;remittance&#8221; man. &#8220;You&#8217;re a heap fat, an&#8217;
need somethin&#8217; to get it down. How you fancy things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d as lief scrap &#8217;side these scalliwags as ag&#8217;in &#8217;em,&#8221; he
replied, indicating his companions with an amiable grin.</p>
<p>Bill nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;This yere Trust is a proper an&#8217; well-found enterprise,&#8221;
he said gravely. &#8220;As fer Minky, I guess we can count him
in most anything that ain&#8217;t dishonest. So&ndash;&ndash;wal, this is jest
precautions. Ther&#8217;s nuthin&#8217; doin&#8217; yet. But you see,&#8221; he
added, with a shadowy grin, &#8220;life&#8217;s mostly chock-full of
fancy things we don&#8217;t figger on, an&#8217; anyway I can&#8217;t set
around easy when folks gets gay. I&#8217;ll be back to hum day
after to-morrer, or the next day, an&#8217;, meanwhiles, you&#8217;ll see
things are right with Zip. An&#8217; don&#8217;t kep far away from
Minky&#8217;s store when strangers is around. Minky&#8217;s a good
friend o&#8217; mine, an&#8217; a good friend to most o&#8217; you, so&ndash;&ndash;well,
guns is good med&#8217;cine ef folks git gay, an&#8217; are yearnin&#8217; to
handle dust what ain&#8217;t theirs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Them strangers?&#8221; suggested Sandy. &#8220;Is&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strangers is strangers, an&#8217; gold-dust is gold-dust,&#8221; he
said shrewdly. &#8220;An&#8217; when the two git together ther&#8217;s
gener&#8217;ly a disease sets in that guns is the best med&#8217;cine for.
That&#8217;s &#8217;bout all.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>ZIP&#8217;S GRATITUDE</h3>
</div>
<p>What a complicated machinery human nature is! It
seems absurd that a strongly defined character should be just
as full of surprises as the weakest; that the fantastic, the
unexpected, even the illogical, are as surely found in the one
as in the other. It would be so nice, so simple and easy, to
sit down and foreshadow a certain course of action for a
certain individual under a given stress; and to be sure that,
in human psychology, two and two make precisely four, no
more and no less.</p>
<p>But such is not the case. In human psychology two and
two can just as easily make ten, or fifteen, or any other
number; and prophecy in the matter is about as great a
waste of time as worrying over the possibilities of the
weather. The constitution of the nervous system cannot be
estimated until put to the test. And when the first test has
revealed to us the long-awaited secret, it is just as likely to be
flatly contradicted by the second. The whole thing is the
very mischief.</p>
<p>Those who knew him would have been quite certain that
in Scipio&#8217;s case there could only be one result from the
addition of the two and two of his psychology. In a man
of his peculiar mental caliber it might well seem that there
could be no variation to the sum. And the resulting prophecy
would necessarily be an evil, or at least a pessimistic one.
He was so helpless, so lacking in all the practicalities of
human life. He seemed to have one little focus that was
quite incapable of expansion, of adaptability. That focus
was almost entirely filled by his Jessie&#8217;s image, with just a
small place in it reserved for his twins. Take the woman
out of it, and, to all intents and purposes, he looked out upon
a dead white blank.</p>
<p>Every thought in his inadequate brain was centered round
his wife. She was the mainspring of his every emotion.
His love for her was his whole being. It was something so
great and strong that it enveloped all his senses. She was
his, and he was incapable of imagining life without her.
She was his, and only death could alter so obvious a fact.
She was his vanguard in life&#8217;s battle, a support that shored
up his confidence and courage to face, with a calm determination,
whatever that battle had to offer him.</p>
<p>But with Jessie&#8217;s going all prophecy would have remained
unfulfilled. Scipio did not go under in the manner to have
been expected of him. After the first shock, outwardly at
least, there appeared to be no change in him. His apparently
colorless personality drifted on in precisely the same amiable,
inconsequent manner. What his moments of solitude
were, only he knew. The agony of grief through which he
passed, the long sleepless nights, the heartbreaking sense of
loss, these things lay hidden under his meaningless exterior,
which, however, defied the revelation of his secret.</p>
<p>After the passing of the first madness which had sent him
headlong in pursuit of his wife, a sort of mental evolution set
in. That unadaptable focus of his promptly became adaptable.
And where it had been incapable of expansion, it
slowly began to expand. It grew, and, whereas before his
Jessie had occupied full place, his twins now became the
central feature.</p>
<p>The original position was largely reversed, but it was
chiefly the growth of the images of his children, and not the
diminishing of the figure of his wife. And with this new
aspect came calmness. Nothing could change his great love
for his erring Jessie, nothing could wipe out his sense of
loss; his grief was always with him. But whereas, judged
by the outward seeming of his character, he should have been
crushed under Fate&#8217;s cruel blow, an inverse process seemed
to have set in. He was lifted, exalted to the almost sublime
heights where his beacon-fire of duty shone.</p>
<p>Yes, but the whole thing was so absurdly twisted. The
care of his children occupied his entire time now, so that his
work, in seeking that which was required to support them,
had to be entirely neglected. He had fifty dollars between
him and starvation for his children. Nor could he see his
way to earning more. The struggles of his unpractical mind
were painful. It was a problem quite beyond him. He
struggled nobly with it, but he saw no light ahead, and, with
that curious singleness of purpose that was his, he eventually
abandoned the riddle, and devoted his whole thought to the
children. Any other man would probably have decided to
hire himself out to work on the claims of other men, and so
hope to earn sufficient to hire help in the care of the twins,
but not so Scipio. He believed that their future well-being
lay in his claim. If that could not be worked, then there
was no other way.</p>
<p>He had just finished clearing up his hut, and the twins
were busy with their games outside in the sun, aided by their
four-legged yellow companion, whose voice was always to be
heard above their excited squabblings and laughter. So
Sunny Oak found things when he slouched up to the hut with
the result of the Trust&#8217;s overnight meeting in his pocket.</p>
<p>The loafer came in with a grin of good-nature on his
perspiring and dirty face. He was feeling very self-righteous.
It was pleasant to think he was doing a good work.
So much so that the effort of doing it did not draw the usual
protest from him.</p>
<p>He glanced about him with a tolerant eye, feeling that
henceforth, under the guidance of the Trust he represented,
Scipio&#8217;s condition would certainly be improved. But somehow
his mental patronage received a quiet set-back. The
hut looked so different. There was a wholesome cleanliness
about it that was quite staggering. Sunny remembered it as
it was when he had last seen it under his r&eacute;gime, and the
contrast was quite startling. Scipio might be incapable of
organization, but he certainly could scour and scrub.</p>
<p>Sunny raked at his beard with his unclean finger-nails.
Yes, Zip must have spent hours of unremitting labor on the
place since he had seen it last.</p>
<p>However, he lost no time in carrying out his mission.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kind o&#8217; busy, Zip?&#8221; he greeted the little man pleasantly.</p>
<p>Scipio raised a pair of shadowed eyes from the inside of
the well-scoured fry-pan he was wiping.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m mostly through fixin&#8217; these chores&ndash;&ndash;for awhiles,&#8221;
he replied quietly. Then he nodded in the direction of the
children&#8217;s voices. &#8220;Guess I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to take the kiddies down
to the creek to clean &#8217;em. They need cleanin&#8217; a heap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny nodded gravely. He was thinking of those things
he had so carefully written out.</p>
<p>&#8220;They sure do,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;Bath oncet a week. But
not use a hand-scrubber, though,&#8221; he added, under a wave of
memory. &#8220;Kids is tender skinned,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pore little bits,&#8221; the father murmured tenderly. Then
he went on more directly to his visitor. &#8220;But they do need
washin&#8217;. It&#8217;s kind o&#8217; natural fer kids to fancy dirt. After
that,&#8221; he went on, his eyes drifting over to a pile of dirty
clothes stacked on a chair, &#8220;I&#8217;ll sure have to do a bit of
washing.&#8221; He set the frying-pan down beside the stove and
moved over to the clothes, picking up the smallest pair of
child&#8217;s knickers imaginable. They were black with dirt, and
he held them up before Sunny&#8217;s wondering eyes and smiled
pathetically. &#8220;Ridic&#8217;lous small,&#8221; he said, with an odd twist
of his pale lips. &#8220;Pore little gal.&#8221; Then his scanty eyebrows
drew together perplexedly, and that curious expression
of helplessness that was his crept into his eyes. &#8220;Them
frills an&#8217; bits git me some,&#8221; he said in a puzzled way.
&#8220;Y&#8217;see, I ain&#8217;t never used an iron much, to speak of. It&#8217;s
kind of awkward using an iron.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny nodded. Somehow he wished he knew something
about using an iron. Birdie had said nothing about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you hot it on the stove,&#8221; he hazarded, after a
moment&#8217;s thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;d say you hot it,&#8221; agreed Scipio. &#8220;It&#8217;s after
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Sunny found himself thinking hard. &#8220;You
got an iron?&#8221; he inquired presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure&ndash;&ndash;two.&#8221; Scipio laid the knickers aside. &#8220;You
hot one while you use the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny nodded again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; the other went on, considering, &#8220;these pretties
needs washin&#8217; first. Well, then I guess they need to dry.
Now, &#8217;bout starch? &#8217;Most everything needs starch. At
least, ther&#8217; always seems to be starch around washing-time.
Y&#8217;see, I ain&#8217;t wise to starch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blamed if I am either,&#8221; agreed Sunny. Then his more
practical mind asserted itself. &#8220;Say, starch kind o&#8217; fixes
things hard, don&#8217;t it?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sure does.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio was trying to follow out his companion&#8217;s train of
thought.</p>
<p>Sunny suddenly sat down on the edge of the table and
grinned triumphantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t use it,&#8221; he cried, with finality. &#8220;You need to
remember kiddies is tender skinned, anyway. Starch&#8217;ll
sure make &#8217;em sore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio brightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; he agreed, with relief. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t jest think
about that. I&#8217;m a heap obliged, Sunny. You always seem
to help me out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The flush of pleasure which responded to the little man&#8217;s
tribute was quite distinguishable through the dirt on the
loafer&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it,&#8221; he said embarrassedly. &#8220;It&#8217;s easy,
two thinkin&#8217; together. &#8217;Sides, I&#8217;ve tho&#8217;t a heap &#8217;bout things
since&ndash;&ndash;since I started to fix your kiddies right. Y&#8217;see, it
ain&#8217;t easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it just ain&#8217;t. That is, y&#8217;see, I ain&#8217;t grumbling,&#8221;
Scipio went on hurriedly, lest his meaning should be mistaken.
&#8220;If you&#8217;re stuck on kiddies, like me, it don&#8217;t worry
you nuthin&#8217;. Kind of makes it pleasant thinkin&#8217; how you
can fix things fer &#8217;em, don&#8217;t it? But it sure ain&#8217;t easy doing
things just right. That&#8217;s how I mean. An&#8217; don&#8217;t it make
you feel good when you do fix things right fer &#8217;em? But I
don&#8217;t guess that comes often, though,&#8221; he added, with a sigh.
&#8220;Y&#8217;see, I&#8217;m kind of awkward. I ain&#8217;t smart, like you or
Bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Bill&#8217;s real smart,&#8221; Sunny began. Then he checked
himself. He was to keep Bill&#8217;s name out of this matter, and
he just remembered it in time. So he veered round quickly.
&#8220;But I ain&#8217;t smart,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Anything I know I got
from a leddy friend. Y&#8217;see, women-folk knows a heap &#8217;bout
kiddies, which, I &#8217;lows, is kind o&#8217; natural.&#8221;</p>
<p>He fumbled in his pocket and drew out several sheets of
paper. Arranging them carefully, he scanned the scrawling
writing on them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;re a scholar, so I won&#8217;t need to read what I
writ down here. Mebbe you&#8217;ll be able to read it yourself.
I sure &#8217;low the spellin&#8217; ain&#8217;t jest right, but you&#8217;ll likely understand
it. Y&#8217;see, the writin&#8217;s clear, which is the chief thing.
I was allus smart with a pen. Now, this yer is jest how our&ndash;&ndash;my&ndash;&ndash;leddy
frien&#8217; reckons kids needs fixin&#8217;. It ain&#8217;t reasonable
to guess everything&#8217;s down ther&#8217;. They&#8217;re jest sort
o&#8217; principles which you need to foller. Maybe they&#8217;ll help
you some. Guess if you foller them reg&#8217;lations your kids&#8217;ll
sure grow proper.&#8221;</p>
<p>He handed the papers across, and Scipio took them only
too willingly. His thanks, his delight, was in the sudden
lighting up of his whole face. But he did not offer a verbal
expression of his feelings until he had read down the
first page. Then he looked up with eyes that were almost
moist with gratitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he began, &#8220;I can&#8217;t never tell you how &#8217;bliged I am,
Sunny. These things have bothered me a whole heap. It&#8217;s
kind of you, Sunny, it is, sure. I&#8217;m that obliged I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; broke in the loafer, &#8220;that sort o&#8217; talk sort o&#8217;
worrits my brain. Cut it out.&#8221; Then he grinned. &#8220;Y&#8217;see,
I ain&#8217;t used to thinkin&#8217; hard. It&#8217;s mostly in the natur&#8217; o&#8217;
work, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;well, work an&#8217; me ain&#8217;t been friends for years.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Scipio was devouring the elaborated information
Sunny had so laboriously set out. The loafer&#8217;s picturesque
mind had drawn heavily on its resources, and Birdie&#8217;s principles
had undergone a queer metamorphosis. So much so,
that she would now have had difficulty in recognizing them.
Sunny watched him reading with smiling interest. He was
looking for those lights and shades which he hoped his illuminating
phraseology would inspire. But Scipio was in
deadly earnest. Phraseology meant nothing to him. It was
the guidance he was looking for and devouring hungrily.
At last he looked up, his pale eyes glowing.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine,&#8221; he exclaimed, with such a wonderful relief
that it was impossible to doubt his appreciation. Then he
glanced round the room. He found some pins and promptly
pinned the sheets on the cupboard door. Then he stood
back and surveyed them. &#8220;You&#8217;re a good friend, Sunny,&#8221;
he said earnestly. &#8220;Now I can&#8217;t never make a mistake.
There it is all wrote ther&#8217;. An&#8217; when I ain&#8217;t sure &#8217;bout nothing,
why, I only jest got to read what you wrote. I don&#8217;t
guess the kiddies can reach them there. Y&#8217;see, kiddies is
queer &#8217;bout things. Likely they&#8217;d get busy tearing those
sheets right up, an&#8217; then wher&#8217;d I be? I&#8217;ll start right in now
on those reg&#8217;lations, an&#8217; you&#8217;ll see how proper the kiddies&#8217;ll
grow.&#8221; He turned and held out his hand to his benefactor.
&#8220;I&#8217;m &#8217;bliged, Sunny; I sure can&#8217;t never thank you enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny disclaimed such a profusion of gratitude, but his
dirty face shone with good-natured satisfaction as he gripped
the little man&#8217;s hand. And after discussing a few details
and offering a few suggestions, which, since the acceptance
of his efforts, seemed to trip off his tongue with an easy confidence
which surprised even himself, he took his departure.
And he left the hut with the final picture of Scipio, still
studying his pages of regulations with the earnestness of a
divinity student studying his Bible, filling his strongly imaginative
brain. He felt good. He felt so good that he was
sorry there was nothing more to be done until Wild Bill&#8217;s
return.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>JESSIE&#8217;S LETTER</h3>
</div>
<p>Scipio&#8217;s long day was almost over. The twins were in
bed, and the little man was lounging for a few idle moments
in the doorway of his hut. Just now an armistice in his
conflict of thought was declared. For the moment the
exigencies of his immediate duties left him floundering in
the wilderness of his desolate heart at the mercy of the pain
of memory. All day the claims of his children had upborne
him. He had had little enough time to think of anything
else, and thus, with his peculiar sense of duty militating
in his favor, he had found strong support for the burden
of his grief.</p>
<p>But now with thought and muscles relaxed, and the long
night stretching out its black wings before him, the gray
shadow had risen uppermost in his mind once more, and a
weight of unutterable loneliness and depression bore down
his spirit.</p>
<p>His faded eyes were staring out at the dazzling reflections
of the setting sun upon the silvery crests of the distant
mountain peaks. In every direction upon the horizon
stretched the wonderful fire of sunset. Tongues of flame,
steely, glowing, ruddy, shot up and athwart the picture in
ever-changing hues before his unseeing eyes. It was all
lost upon him. He stared mechanically, while his busy brain
struggled amongst a tangle of memories and thought pictures.
The shadows of his misfortune were hard besetting
him.</p>
<p>Amidst his other troubles had come a fresh realization
which filled him with something like panic. He had been
forced to purchase stores for his household. To do so he
had had to pay out the last of his fourth ten-dollar bill. His
exchequer was thus reduced to ten dollars. Ten dollars
stood between him and starvation for his children. Nor
could he see the smallest prospect of obtaining more. His
imagination was stirred. He saw in fancy the specter of
starvation looming, hungrily stretching out its gaunt arms,
clutching at his two helpless infants. He had no thought
for himself. It did not occur to him that he, too, must
starve. He only pictured the wasting of the children&#8217;s
round little bodies, he heard their weakly whimperings at the
ravages of hunger&#8217;s pangs. He saw the tottering gait as
they moved about, unconscious of the trouble that was theirs,
only knowing that they were hungry. Their requests for
food rang in his ears, maddening him with the knowledge of
his helplessness. He saw them growing weaker day by day.
He saw their wondering, wistful, uncomprehending eyes, so
bright and beautiful now, growing bigger and bigger as their
soft cheeks fell away. He&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>He moved nervously. He shifted his position, vainly trying
to rid himself of the haunting vision. But panic was
upon him. Starvation&ndash;&ndash;that was it. Starvation! God!
how terrible was the thought. Starvation! And yet, before&ndash;&ndash;before
Jessie had gone he had been no better off.
He had had only fifty dollars. But somehow it was all
different then. She was there, and he had had confidence.
Now&ndash;&ndash;now he had none. Then she was there to manage,
and he was free to work upon his claim.</p>
<p>Ah, his claim. That was it. The claim lay idle now
with all its hidden wealth. How he wanted that wealth
which he so believed to be there. No, he could not work
his claim. The children could not be left alone all day.
That was out of the question. They must be cared for.
How&ndash;&ndash;how?</p>
<p>His brain grew hot, and he broke out into a sweat. His
head drooped forward until his unshaven chin rested upon
his sunken chest. His eyes were lusterless, his two rough
hands clenched nervously. Just for one weak moment he
longed for forgetfulness. He longed to shut out those
hideous visions with which he was pursued. He longed for
peace, for rest from the dull aching of his poor torn heart.
His courage was at a low ebb. Something of the nature of
the hour had got hold of him. It was sundown. There was
the long black night between him and the morrow. He felt
so helpless, so utterly incapable.</p>
<p>But his moment passed. He raised his head. He stood
erect from the door casing. He planted his feet firmly, and
his teeth gritted. The spirit of the man rose again. He
must not give way. He would not. The children should
not starve while there was food in the world. If he had
no money, he had two strong hands and&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>He started. A sudden noise behind him turned him facing
about with bristling nerves. What was it? It sounded
like the falling of a heavy weight. And yet it did not sound
like anything big. The room was quite still, and looked, in
the growing dusk, just the same as usual.</p>
<p>Suddenly the children leapt into his thought, and he
started for the inner room. But he drew up short as he
passed behind the table. A large stone was lying at his feet,
and a folded paper was tied about it. He glanced round at
the window and&ndash;&ndash;understood.</p>
<p>He stooped and picked the missile up. Then he moved
to the window and looked out. There was no one about.
The evening shadows were rapidly deepening, but he was
sure there was no one about. He turned back to the door
where there was still sufficient light for his purposes. He
sat down upon the sill with the stone in his hand. He was
staring at the folded paper.</p>
<p>Yes, he understood. And instinctively he knew that the
paper was to bring him fresh disaster. He knew it was a
letter. And he knew whence it came.</p>
<p>At last he looked up. The mystery of the letter remained.
It was there in his hand, waiting the severing of the string
that held it, but somehow as yet he lacked the courage to
read it. And so some moments passed. But at last he
sighed and looked at it again. Then he reached round to his
hip for his sheath-knife. The stone dropped to the ground,
and with it the outer covering of the letter. With trembling
fingers he unfolded the notepaper.</p>
<p>Yes, it was as he expected, as he knew, a letter from
Jessie. And as he read it his heart cried out, and the warm
blood in his veins seemed to turn to water. He longed for
the woman whose hand had penned those words as he had
never longed for anything in his life. All the old wound
was ruthlessly torn open, and it was as though a hot, searing
iron had been thrust into its midst. He cared nothing for
what she had done or was. He wanted her.</p>
<p>It was a letter full of pathetic pleading for the possession
of Vada. It was not a demand. It was an appeal. An
appeal to all that was his better nature. His honesty, his
manliness, his simple unselfishness. It was a letter thrilling
with the outpourings of a mother&#8217;s heart craving for possession
of the small warm life that she had been at such pains
to bestow. It was the mother talking to him as he had
never heard the wife and woman talk. There was a passion,
a mother love in the hastily scrawled words that drove
straight to the man&#8217;s simple heart. One little paragraph
alone set his whole body quivering with responsive emotion,
and started the weak tears to his troubled eyes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Let me have her, Zip. Let me have her. Maybe I&#8217;ve
lost my right, but I&#8217;m her mother. I brought her into the
world, Zip. And what that means you can never understand.
She&#8217;s my flesh and blood. She&#8217;s part of me. I
gave her the life she&#8217;s got. I&#8217;m her mother, Zip, and I&#8217;ll go
mad without her.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He read and re-read the letter. He would have read it a
third time, but the tears blinded his eyes and he crushed it
into his pocket. His heart yearned for her. It cried out
to him in a great pity. It tore him so that he was drawn
to words spoken aloud to express his feelings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor gal,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Poor gal. Oh, my Jessie,
what you done&ndash;&ndash;what you done?&#8221;</p>
<p>He dashed a hand across his eyes to wipe away the mist
of tears that obscured his vision and stood up. He was face
to face with a situation that might well have confounded
him. But here, where only his heart and not his head was
appealed to, there was no confusion.</p>
<p>The woman had said he could not understand. She had
referred to her motherhood. But Scipio was a man who
could understand just that. He could understand with his
heart, where his head might have failed him. He read into
the distracted woman&#8217;s letter a meaning that perhaps no
other man could have read into it. He read a human soul&#8217;s
agony at the severing of itself from all that belonged to its
spiritual side. He read more than the loss of the woman&#8217;s
offspring. He read the despairing thought, perhaps unconscious,
of a woman upon whom repentance has begun its
work. And his simple heart went out to her, yearning, loving.
He knew that her appeal was granted even before he
acknowledged it to himself.</p>
<p>And strangely enough the coming of that letter&ndash;&ndash;he did
not pause to think how it had come&ndash;&ndash;produced a miraculous
change in him. His spirit rose thrilling with hope, and
filled with a courage which, but a few moments before,
seemed to have gone from him forever. He did not understand,
he did not pause to think. How could he? To him
she was still his Jessie, the love and hope of his life. It was
her hand that had penned that letter. It was her woman&#8217;s
heart appealing to his mercy.</p>
<p>&#8220;God in heaven,&#8221; he cried, appealing to the blue vault
above him in which the stars were beginning to appear. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t refuse her. I just can&#8217;t. She wants her so&ndash;&ndash;my
poor, poor Jessie.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It was late in the evening when Scipio returned from the
camp driving Minky&#8217;s buckskin mule and ancient buckboard.
His mind was made up. He would start out directly after
breakfast on the morrow. He had resorted to a pitiful
little subterfuge in borrowing Minky&#8217;s buckboard. He had
told the storekeeper that he had heard of a prospect some
distance out, and he wanted to inspect it. He said he intended
to take Vada with him, but wished to leave Jamie behind.
Minky, as a member of the Trust, had promptly lent
him the conveyance, and volunteered to have Jamie looked
after down at the store by Birdie until he returned. So
everything was made easy for him, and he came back to his
home beyond the dumps with the first feeling of contentment
he had experienced since his wife had deserted him.</p>
<p>Having made the old mule snug for the night on the leeward
side of the house, he prepared to go to bed. There
was just one remaining duty to perform, however, before he
was free to do so. He must set things ready for breakfast
on the morrow. To this end he lit the lamp.</p>
<p>In five minutes his preparations were made, and, after
one final look round, he passed over to the door to secure
it. He stood for a moment drinking in the cool night air.
Yes, he felt happier than he had done for days. Nor could
he have said why. It was surely something to do with
Jessie&#8217;s letter, and yet the letter seemed to offer little
enough for hope.</p>
<p>He was going to part with Vada, a thought which filled
him with dismay, and yet there was hope in his heart. But
then where the head might easily enough fail his heart had
accepted responsibility. There was a note in the woman&#8217;s
appeal which struck a responsive chord in his own credulous
heart, and somehow he felt that his parting with Vada was
not to be for long. He felt that Jessie would eventually
come back to him. He felt, though he did not put the
thought into words, that no woman could feel as she did
about her children, and be utterly dead to all the old affection
that had brought them into the world.</p>
<p>He turned away at last. The air was good to breathe to-night,
the world was good after all. Yes, it was better than
he had thought it. There was much to be done to-morrow,
so he would &#8220;turn in.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was at that moment that something white lying at his
feet caught his eye. Instantly he remembered it, and, stooping,
picked it up. How strange it was the difference of his
feelings as he lifted the outer wrapping of Jessie&#8217;s letter now.
There was something almost reverent in the way he handled
the paper.</p>
<p>He closed the door and secured it, and went across to the
lamp, where he stood looking down at the stained and dirty
covering. He turned it over, his thoughts abstracted
and busy with the woman who had folded it ready for
its journey to him. Yes, she had folded it, she had sent it,
she&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Suddenly his abstraction passed, and he bent over the disfiguring
finger-marks. There was writing upon the paper,
and the writing was not in Jessie&#8217;s hand. He raised it closer
to his eyes and began to read. And, with each word he
made out, his faculties became more and more angrily
concentrated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll hand the kid over at once. I&#8217;ll be on the Spawn
City trail ten miles out. If you ain&#8217;t there with the kid noon
to-morrow there&#8217;s going to be bad trouble.</p>
<p class='ralign'><span class='smcap'>James</span>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;James! James!&#8221; Scipio almost gasped the name.
His pale eyes were hot and furious, and the blood surged to
his brain.</p>
<p>He had forgotten James until now. He had forgotten
the traitor responsible for his undoing. So much was Jessie
in his life that James had counted for little when he thought
of her. But now the scoundrel swept all other thoughts
pell-mell out of his head. He was suddenly ablaze with a
rage such as he had never before experienced. All that was
human in him was in a state of fierce resentment. He hated
James, and desired with all his small might to do him a bodily
hurt. Yes, he could even delight in killing him. He would
show him no mercy. He would revel in witnessing his death
agonies. This man had not only wronged him. He had
killed also the spiritual purity of the mother of his children.
Oh, how he hated him. And now&ndash;&ndash;now he had dared to
threaten. He, stained to his very heart&#8217;s core with villainy,
had dared to interfere in a matter which concerned a
mother&#8217;s pure love for her children. The thought maddened
him, and he crushed the paper in his hand and ground
it under his heel.</p>
<p>He would not do it. He could not. He had forgotten
the association to which he was sending the innocent Vada.
No, no. Innocent little Vada. Jessie must do without her.</p>
<p>He flung himself into a chair and gave himself up to
passionate thought. For two hours he sat there raging, half
mad with his hideous feelings against James. But as the
long hours slipped away he slowly calmed. His hatred remained
for the man, but he kept it out of his silent struggle
with himself. In spite of his first heated decision he was
torn by a guiding instinct that left him faltering. He realized
that his hatred of the man, and nothing else, was really
responsible for his negative attitude. And this was surely
wrong. What he must really consider was the welfare of
Vada, and&ndash;&ndash;Jessie. The whole thing was so difficult, so
utterly beyond him. He was drawn this way and that,
struggling with a brain that he knew to be incompetent.
But in the end it was again his heart that was victorious.
Again his heart would take no denial.</p>
<p>Confused, weary, utterly at a loss to finally decide, he
drew out Jessie&#8217;s letter again. He read it. And like a cloud
his confusion dispersed and his mind became clear. His
hatred of James was thrust once more into the background.
Jessie&#8217;s salvation depended on Vada&#8217;s going. Vada must go.</p>
<p>He sighed as he rose from his chair and blew out the
lamp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m wrong,&#8221; he murmured, passing into the bedroom.
&#8220;Maybe. Well, I guess God&#8217;ll have to judge me,
and&ndash;&ndash;He knows.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>ON THE ROAD</h3>
</div>
<p>Wild Bill had many things to think of on his way back
to Suffering Creek. He was a tremendously alert-minded
man at all times, so alert-minded that at no time was he given
to vain imaginings, and to be alone for long together chafed
and irritated him to a degree. His life was something more
than practicality; it was vigor in an extreme sense. He
must be doing; he must be going ahead. And it mattered
very little to him whether he was using vigor of mind or
body. Just now he was using the former to a purpose.
Possibilities and scheming flashed through his head in such
swift succession as to be enough to dazzle a man of lesser
mental caliber.</p>
<p>The expressed object of his visit to Spawn City was only
one of several purposes he had in hand. And though he
turned up at the principal hotel at the psychological moment
when he could drop into the big game of poker he had promised
himself, and though at that game he helped himself,
with all the calm amiability in the world, to several thousand
dollars of the &#8220;rich guys&#8217;&#8221; money, the rest of his visit to the
silver city was spent in moving about amongst the lower
haunts where congregated the human jackals which hunt on
the outskirts of such places.</p>
<p>And in these places he met many friends and acquaintances
with whom he fraternized for the time being. And
his sojourn cost him a good many dollars, dollars which he
shed unstintingly, even without counting. Nor was he the
man to part with his money in this casual manner without
obtaining adequate return, and yet all he had to show as a
result of his expedition was a word of information here and
there, a suggestion or two which would scarcely have revealed
to the outsider the interest which they held for him.
Yet he seemed satisfied. He seemed very well satisfied
indeed, and his reckless spirit warmed as he progressed in
his peregrinations.</p>
<p>Then, too, he &#8220;dined&#8221; the sheriff of the county at the
only restaurant worth while. He spent more than two hours
in this man&#8217;s company, and his wine bill was in due proportion
to the hardy official&#8217;s almost unlimited capacity for
liquid refreshment. Yet even to the most interested his
purpose would have needed much explanation. He asked
so few questions. He seemed to lead the conversation in
no particular direction. He simply allowed talk to drift
whither it would. And somehow it always seemed to drift
whither he most desired it.</p>
<p>Yes, his movements were quite curious during his visit,
and yet they were commonplace enough to suggest nothing
of the depth of subtlety which really actuated them. There
was even an absurd moment which found him in a candy-store
purchasing several pounds of the most sickly candy he
could buy in so rough a place as the new silver town.</p>
<p>However, the time came for him at last to get out on the
road again for home. And, having prepared his team for
the journey, he hitched them up to his spring-cart himself,
paid his bill, and, with a flourish of his whip, and a swagger
which only a team of six such magnificent horses as he possessed
could give him, left the hotel at a gallop, the steely
muscles of his arms controlling his fiery children as easily as
the harsh voice of a northern half-breed controls a racing
dog-train.</p>
<p>And on the journey home his thoughts were never idle for
a moment. So busy were they that the delicious calm of the
night, the wonders of the following dawn, the glory of a
magnificent sunrise over a green world of mountain, valley
and plain, were quite lost to his unpoetic soul. The only
things which seemed able to distract his concentrated
thoughts were the fiercely buzzing mosquitoes, and these he
cursed with whole-hearted enthusiasm which embraced a
perfect vocabulary of lurid blasphemy.</p>
<p>Twice on the journey he halted and unhitched his horses
for feed and drink and a roll. But the delays were short,
and his vigorous methods gave them but short respite. He
cared for his equine friends with all his might, and he drove
them in a similar manner. This was the man. A life on a
bed of roses would not have been too good for his horses,
but if he so needed it they would have to repay him by driving
over a red-hot trail.</p>
<p>Now the home stretch lay before him, some twenty miles
through a wonderful broken country, all spruce and pine
forests, crag and valley, threaded by a white hard trail which
wound its way amidst Nature&#8217;s chaos in a manner similar
to that in which a mountain stream cuts its course, percolating
along the path of the least resistance.</p>
<p>Through this splendid country the untiring team traveled,
hauling their feather-weight burden as though there was
nothing more joyous in life. In spite of the length of the
journey the gambler had to keep a tight pressure on the reins,
or the willing beasts would, at any moment, have broken into
a headlong gallop. Their barn lay ahead of them, and their
master sat behind them. What more could they want?</p>
<p>Up a sharp incline, and the race down the corresponding
decline. The wide stretch of valley bottom, and again a
steep ascent. There was no slackening of gait, scarcely a
hard breath. Only the gush of eager nostrils in the bright
morning air of the mountains. Now along a forest-bounded
stretch of level trail, winding, and full of protruding tree-stumps
and roots. There was no stumbling. The surefooted
thoroughbreds cleared each obstruction with mechanical
precision, and only the spring-cart bore the burden of
impact.</p>
<p>On, up out of the darkened valley to a higher level above,
where the high hills sloped away upwards, admitting the
dazzling daylight so that the whole scene was lit to a perfect
radiance, and the nip of mountain air filled the lungs with
an invigorating tonic.</p>
<p>At last the traveler dropped down into the wide valley, in
the midst of which he first came into touch with the higher
reaches of Suffering Creek. Here it flowed a sluggish, turgid
stream, so sullen, so heavy. It was narrow, and at points
curiously black in tone. There was none of the freshness,
the rushing, tumultuous flow of a mountain torrent about it
here. Its banks were marshy with a wide spread of oozy
soil, and miry reeds grew in abundance. The trail cut well
away from the bed of the creek, mounting the higher land
where the soil, in curious contrast, was sandy, and the surface
deep in a silvery dust. To an observer the curiosity of
the contrast must have been striking, but Wild Bill was not
in an observant mood. He was busy with his horses&ndash;&ndash;and
his thoughts.</p>
<p>He was traveling now in a cloud of dust. And it was
this, no doubt, which accounted for the fact that he did not
see a buckboard drawn by an aged mule until he heard a
shout, and his horses swung off the trail of their own accord.
Quick as lightning he drew them up with a violent curse.</p>
<p>&#8220;What in hell&ndash;&ndash;!&#8221; he roared. But he broke off suddenly
as the dust began to clear, and he saw the yellow-headed
figure of Scipio seated in the buckboard, with Vada
beside him, just abreast of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mackinaw!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;What you doin&#8217; out here?&#8221;</p>
<p>So startled was the gambler at the unexpected vision that
he made no attempt to even guess at Scipio&#8217;s purpose. He
put his question without another thought behind it.</p>
<p>Scipio, whose mule had jumped at the opportunity of discontinuing
its laborious effort, and was already reaching out
at the grass lining the trail, passed a hand across his brow
before answering. It was as though he were trying to fix
in his mind the reason of his own presence there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he said hesitatingly, &#8220;why, I&#8217;m out after a&ndash;&ndash;a
prospect I heard of. Want to get a peek at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latter was said with more assurance, and he smiled
vaguely into his friend&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>But Bill had gathered his scattered wits, and had had time
to think. He nodded at little Vada, who was interestedly
staring at the satin coats of his horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you takin&#8217; her out to help you locate it?&#8221; he inquired,
with a raising of his shaggy brows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not just that,&#8221; Scipio responded uncomfortably. He
found it curiously difficult to lie with Bill&#8217;s steady eyes fixed
on him. &#8220;Y&#8217;see&ndash;&ndash;Say, am I near ten miles out from
the camp?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not by three miles.&#8221; Bill was watching him intently.
He saw the pale eyes turn away and glance half fearfully
along the trail. Then they suddenly came back, and Scipio
gazed at the child beside him. He sighed and lifted his
reins.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll get on then,&#8221; he said in the dogged tone of a
man who has made up his mind to an unpleasant task.</p>
<p>But Bill had no intention of letting him go yet. He
sat back in his seat, his hand holding his reins loosely in
his lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;That wher&#8217; your prospect is?&#8221; he inquired casually.</p>
<p>Scipio nodded. He could not bring himself to frame any
further aggravation of the lie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wher&#8217; did you hear of the prospect?&#8221; Bill demanded
shrewdly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But little Vada broke in. Her interest had been diverted
by the word prospect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wot&#8217;s &#8217;prospect&#8217;?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>Bill laughed without any change of expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prospect is wher&#8217; you <i>expect</i> to find gold,&#8221; he explained
carefully.</p>
<p>The child&#8217;s eyes widened, and she was about to speak.
Then she hesitated, but finally she proceeded.</p>
<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t wot we&#8217;re goin&#8217; for,&#8221; she said simply.
&#8220;Poppa&#8217;s goin&#8217; to take me wher&#8217; momma is. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to
momma, an&#8217; she&#8217;s ever so far away. Pop told me. Jamie&#8217;s
goin&#8217; to stay with him, an&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to stay with momma,
an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;I want Jamie to come too.&#8221; Tears suddenly
crowded her eyes, and slowly rolled down her sunburned
cheeks.</p>
<p>Just for a moment neither man spoke. Bill&#8217;s fierce eyes
were curiously alight, and they were sternly fixed on the
averted face of the father. At last Scipio turned towards
him; and with his first words he showed his relief that further
lying was out of the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot&ndash;&ndash;somehow&ndash;&ndash;she knew. Y&#8217;see&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Bill, who had just bitten off a fresh chew of tobacco,
gave him no chance to continue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he interrupted him, &#8220;ther&#8217;s lies I hate, an&#8217; ther&#8217;s
lies that don&#8217;t make no odds. You&#8217;ve lied in a way I hate.
You&#8217;ve lied &#8217;cos you had to lie, knowin&#8217; you was doin&#8217; wrong.
If you hadn&#8217;t know&#8217;d you was doin&#8217; wrong you wouldn&#8217;t
have needed to lie&ndash;&ndash;sure. Say, you&#8217;re not only handin&#8217;
over that kiddie to her mother, you&#8217;re handin&#8217; her over to
that feller. Now, get to it an&#8217; tell me things. An&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;you
needn&#8217;t to lie any.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio hung his head. These words coming from Wild
Bill suddenly put an entirely different aspect upon his action.
He saw something of the horror he was committing as Bill
saw it. He was seeing through another man&#8217;s eyes now,
where before he had only seen through his own simple heart,
torn by the emotions his Jessie&#8217;s letter had inspired.</p>
<p>He fumbled in his pocket and drew out his wife&#8217;s letter.
He looked at it, holding it a moment, his whole heart in
his eyes. Then he reached out and passed it to the
gambler.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got to have her,&#8221; he said, with a touch of his native
obstinacy and conviction. &#8220;She&#8217;s her mother. I haven&#8217;t a
right to keep her. I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Bill silenced him without ceremony.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t yap,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;How ken I read this yer muck
with you throwin&#8217; hot air?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio desisted, and sat staring vacantly at the long ears
of Minky&#8217;s mule. He was gazing on a mental picture of
Jessie as he considered she must have looked when writing
that letter. He saw her distress in her beautiful eyes.
There were probably tears in her eyes, too, and the thought
hurt him and made him shrink from it. He felt that her poor
heart must have been breaking when she had written. Perhaps
James had been cruel to her. Yes, he was sure to have
been cruel to her. Such a blackguard as he was sure to be
cruel to women-folk. No doubt she was longing to escape
from him. She was sure to be. She would never have willingly
gone away&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tosh!&#8221; cried Bill. And Scipio found the letter thrust
out for him to take back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said &#8216;tosh!&#8217;&#8221; replied the gambler. &#8220;How&#8217;d you get
that letter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was flung in through the window. It was tied to a
stone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a wrappin&#8217; to it.&#8221; Then Scipio&#8217;s eyes began
to sparkle at the recollection. &#8220;It was wrote on by the
feller James,&#8221; he went on in a low voice.</p>
<p>Then suddenly he turned, and his whole manner partook
of an impotent heat.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d wrote I was to hand her, Vada, over to him ten
miles out on this trail&ndash;&ndash;or there&#8217;d be trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wild Bill stirred and shifted his seat with a fierce dash of
irritation. His face was stern and his black eyes blazing.
He spat out his chew of tobacco.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you was scared to death, like some silly skippin&#8217;
sheep. You hadn&#8217;t bowel enough to tell him to go to hell.
You felt like handin&#8217; him any other old thing you&#8217;d got&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;Here,
go on, help yourself.&#8217;&#8221; He flung out his arms to
illustrate his meaning. &#8220;&#8216;You got my wife; here&#8217;s my
kiddies. If you need anything else, you can sure get my
claim. Guess my shack&#8217;ll make you an elegant summer
palace.&#8217; Gee!&#8221;</p>
<p>The gambler&#8217;s scorn was withering, and with each burst
of it he flourished his arms as though handing out possessions
to an imaginary James. And every word he spoke
smote Scipio, goading him and lashing up the hatred which
burnt deep down in his heart for the man who had ruined
his life.</p>
<p>But the little man&#8217;s thought of Jessie was not so easily set
aside, and he jumped to defend himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he began. But the other cut
him short with a storm of scathing anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I sure don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I don&#8217;t. I sure
don&#8217;t. Guess I&#8217;m on&#8217;y jest a man. I ain&#8217;t no sort o&#8217; bum
angel, nor sanctimonious sky-bustin&#8217; hymn-smiter. I&#8217;m on&#8217;y
a man. An&#8217; I kind o&#8217; thank them as is responsible that I ain&#8217;t
nuthin&#8217; else. Say&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;his piercing eyes seemed to bore their
way right down to the little man&#8217;s heart like red-hot needles&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I
ain&#8217;t got a word to say to you but you orter be herdin&#8217;
wi&#8217; a crowd o&#8217; mangy gophers. Tchah! A crowd o&#8217; maggots
&#8217;ud cut you off&#8217;n their visitin&#8217; list in a diseased carkis.
Here&#8217;s a feller robs you in the meanest way a man ken be
robbed, an&#8217; you&#8217;re yearnin&#8217; to hand him more&ndash;&ndash;a low-down
cur of a stage-robber, a cattle-thief, the lowest down bum
ever created&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; you&#8217;d hand over this pore innercent little
kiddie to him. Was there ever sech a white-livered sucker?
Say, you&#8217;re responsible fer that pore little gal&#8217;s life, you&#8217;re
responsible fer her innercent soul, an&#8217; you&#8217;d hand her over
to James, like the worstest cur in creation. Say, I ain&#8217;t got
words to tell you what you are. You&#8217;re a white-livered bum
that even hell won&#8217;t give room to. You&#8217;re&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, hold on,&#8221; cried Scipio, turning, with his pale eyes
mildly blazing. &#8220;You&#8217;re wrong, all wrong. I ain&#8217;t doing
it because I&#8217;m scared of James. I don&#8217;t care nothing for his
threats. I&#8217;m scared of no man&ndash;&ndash;not even you. See? My
Jessie&#8217;s callin&#8217; for her gal&ndash;&ndash;my Jessie! Do you know what
that means to me? No, of course you don&#8217;t. You don&#8217;t
know my Jessie. You ain&#8217;t never loved a wife like my Jessie.
You ain&#8217;t never felt what a kiddie is to its mother.
You can&#8217;t see as I can see. This little gal,&#8221; he went on, tenderly
laying an arm about Vada&#8217;s small shoulders, &#8220;will,
maybe, save my pore Jessie. That pore gal has hit the wrong
trail, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I&#8217;d sacrifice everything in the world to save
her. I&#8217;d&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;d sell my own soul. I&#8217;d give it to&ndash;&ndash;save her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio looked fearlessly into the gambler&#8217;s eyes. His
pale cheeks were lit by a hectic flush of intense feeling.
There was a light in his eyes of such honesty and devotion
that the other lowered his. He could not look upon it unmoved.</p>
<p>Bill sat back, for once in his life disconcerted. All his
righteous indignation was gone out of him. He was confronted
with a spectacle such as, in his checkered career, he
had never before been brought into contact with. It was
the meeting of two strangely dissimilar, yet perfectly human,
forces. Each was fighting for what he knew to be right.
Each was speaking from the bottom of a heart inspired by
his sense of human right and loyalty. While the gambler,
without subtlety of emotion, saw only with a sense of human
justice, with a hatred of the man who had so wronged
this one, with a desire to thwart him at every turn, the other
possessed a breadth of feeling sufficient to put out of his
thoughts all recollection of his personal wrong, if only he
could help the woman he loved.</p>
<p>It was a meeting of forces widely different, yet each in its
way thrilling with a wonderful honesty of purpose. And,
curiously enough, the purpose of Scipio, who lacked so much
of the other&#8217;s intellect and force, became, in a measure, the
dominating factor. It took hold of the gambler, and stirred
him as he had never been stirred before.</p>
<p>Suddenly Wild Bill leaned forward. Once more those
swift, relentless eyes focused and compelled the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zip,&#8221; he said in a tone that was strangely thrilling,
&#8220;maybe I didn&#8217;t get all you felt&ndash;&ndash;all you got in that tow-head
of yours. That bein&#8217; so, guess I owe you amends.
But I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to ast you to sure fergit that gal&#8217;s letter&ndash;&ndash;fer
awhiles. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to ast you to turn that bussock-headed
mule you&#8217;re drivin&#8217; right around, and hit back for the Creek.
You do this, Zip, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to do. I
ain&#8217;t no sentimental slob. I ain&#8217;t got the makin&#8217;s in me of
even a store-mussed angel. See? But if you do this I
swar to you right here I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to see your Jessie right.
I swar to you I&#8217;ll rid her of this &#8216;Lord&#8217; James, an&#8217; it&#8217;ll jest
be up to you to do the rest. Git me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio took a breath that was something like a gasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ll help me get her back?&#8221; he breathed,
with a glow of hope which almost shocked his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not promisin&#8217; that,&#8221; said Bill quickly. &#8220;That&#8217;s sure
up to you. But I give it you right here, I&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;shift this
doggone skunk out of your way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio made no verbal reply. Just for a moment he
looked into the gimlet eyes of the other. He saw the iron
purpose there. He saw the stern, unyielding compression of
the lean, muscular jaws. There was something tremendous
in the suggestion of power lying behind this ruffian&#8217;s exterior.
He turned away and gathered up the old mule&#8217;s
reins.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve allus been friendly to me, Bill, so&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He pulled off the trail and turned the mule&#8217;s head in the
direction of home. And the rest of the gambler&#8217;s journey
was done in the wake of Minky&#8217;s buckboard.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>A FINANCIAL TRANSACTION</h3>
</div>
<p>Scipio was washing clothes down at the creek. So much
had happened to him that day, so many and various had been
the emotions through which he had passed, that there was
only one thing left him to do. He must work. He dared
not sit down and think. Hard physical labor was what
he required. And the rubbing out of the children&#8217;s small
clothes, and his own somewhat tattered garments, became a
sort of soothing drug which quieted his troubled mind, and
lulled his nerves into a temporary quiescence. The children
were with him, playing unconcernedly upon the muddy
banks of the creek, with all the usual childish zest for anything
so deliciously enticing and soft as liquid river mud.</p>
<p>Vada had forgotten her journey of that morning, it had
quite passed out of her little head in the usual way of such
trifling unpleasantnesses which go so frequently to make up
the tally of childhood&#8217;s days. Jamie had no understanding
of it. His Vada was with him again, hectoring, guiding him
as was her wont, and, in his babyish way, he was satisfied.</p>
<p>As for Scipio he gave no sign of anything. He was concentrating
all his mental energies on the work in hand, thus
endeavoring to shut out memory which possessed nothing
but pain for him. Every now and then a quick, sidelong
glance in the children&#8217;s direction kept him informed of their
doings and safety, otherwise his eyes were rarely raised from
the iron bath, filled to the brim with its frothing suds.</p>
<p>Striding down the slope from the hut where he had come
in search of Scipio, this was the picture Wild Bill discovered.
The little yellow-headed man was standing in the
midst of a small clearing in the bushes, a clearing long since
made for the purposes of his wife&#8217;s weekly wash. His back
was turned, and his small figure was bowed over the tub in
front of him. Every bush around him was decorated with
clothes laid out on their leafy surfaces, where the sun could
best operate its hygienic drying process. He saw the bobbing
heads of the mudlarking children a few yards away
where the low cut-bank hid their small bodies from view.
And somehow an unusual pity stirred his hard, world-worn
heart.</p>
<p>And yet no one could have called him a sentimental man.
At least, no one who knew his method of life. How would
it be possible to gild a man with humane leanings who would
sit in to a game at poker, and, if chance came his way, take
from any opponent his last cent of money, even if he knew
that a wife and children could be reduced to starvation
thereby? How could a kindliness of purpose be read into
the acts of a man who would have no scruple in taking life,
under provocation, without the least mercy or qualm of conscience?
He displayed no tenderness, he hated what he
considered such weakness. It was his studied practice to
avoid showing consideration for others, and he would have
bitterly resented those who considered him. He preferred
that his attitude towards the world should be one of unyielding
selfishness. Such was the game of life as he understood
it.</p>
<p>Yes, honestly enough, he hated sentiment, and for this
very reason he cursed himself bitterly that such a feeling
as he now experienced should so disturb him. He hurried
down the slope a shade quicker than there was any necessity
for. And it was as though he were endeavoring to outstrip
the feelings which pursued him.</p>
<p>Scipio heard him coming, and glanced round quickly.
When he beheld his visitor he nodded a greeting and continued
his work. In his heart was a curious feeling towards
the gambler. He could not have described it. It was too
complicated. He liked Wild Bill. He felt that for some
indefinite reason he was his friend. Yet he resented him,
too. He did not know he resented him. Only he felt that
this man dominated him, and he was forced to obey him
against his will. At sight of him his mind went back to
the events of that morning. He thought of Bill&#8217;s promise,
and a curious excitement stirred within him. He wondered
now what this visit portended.</p>
<p>For once the gambler did not display his usual readiness.
He did not speak for some moments, but took up a position
whence he could see the children at their play, and best watch
the little washerman, on whom he intended to thrust a proposition
that had been revolving in his mind some time. He
chewed his tobacco steadily, while his expression went
through many changes. At last he drew his shaggy brows
together and eyed his victim with shrewd suspicion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you&#8217;re kind o&#8217; smart, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221; he demanded
harshly.</p>
<p>The other looked up with a start, and his mildly inquiring
glance should have convinced the most skeptical to the contrary.
But apparently it had no such effect on his visitor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d never ha&#8217; tho&#8217;t it,&#8221; Bill went on coldly. &#8220;To look
at you one &#8217;ud sure think you was that simple a babby could
fool you. Howsum,&#8221; he sighed, &#8220;I don&#8217;t guess you ken
never rightly tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>A flush began to warm Scipio&#8217;s cheeks. He couldn&#8217;t understand.
He wondered hard, vainly endeavoring to grasp
wherein he had offended.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t get you,&#8221; he said, in a bewildered fashion,
dropping the garment he was washing back into the soapsuds.</p>
<p>Bill&#8217;s expression underwent another change as he caught
at the words.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t get me?&#8221; he said ironically. &#8220;You don&#8217;t get
me?&#8221; Then he shrugged as though he was not angry, but
merely deplored the other&#8217;s unsuspected cunning. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t strike it rich an&#8217; guess you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to blind folks. I&#8217;d
say it needs every sort of a man to do that around these
parts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio gasped. He had no other feeling than blank astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t struck it rich,&#8221; he protested.</p>
<p>And his denial was received with a forced peal of laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you&#8217;re a heap shrewd,&#8221; cried Bill, when his laugh
had subsided. &#8220;I&#8217;d say you&#8217;re jest about slick. Gee! Wal,
I can&#8217;t blame you any fer holdin&#8217; your face shut. Ther&#8217;s
a mint o&#8217; dollars ken drop out of a feller&#8217;s mouth through
an unnatteral openin&#8217;. Ef you&#8217;d got busy gassin&#8217;, it&#8217;s a
million dollar bet all the folks around this lay-out &#8217;ud be
chasin&#8217; you clear to death. Say, it&#8217;s right, though? There&#8217;s
chunks of it stickin&#8217; right out, fine, yaller, dandy gold. An&#8217;
the quartz bank cuttin&#8217; down wider an&#8217; wider?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Scipio shook his head. His bewilderment had gone,
and in place of it was sad conviction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Not yet. I ain&#8217;t seen it, anyway.
I sure think there&#8217;s gold in plenty on that claim. I know
there is,&#8221; he added, with unusual force, his pulses beginning
to quicken, and a sudden hope stirring. Bill&#8217;s accusation
was aiding the effect. &#8220;But it ain&#8217;t on the surface. It
sure ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood wondering, all his washing forgotten in this
newly raised hope so subtly stirred by the gambler. Had
someone else discovered what he had missed for so long?
He hadn&#8217;t been near his claim for some days. Had someone&ndash;&ndash;?</p>
<p>&#8220;Who says about the gold?&#8221; he demanded, with sudden
inspiration.</p>
<p>&#8220;The folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gambler passed the point without committing himself.</p>
<p>Scipio shook his head, puzzling. Something must surely
have transpired, and yet&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You got me beat, Bill. You have, sure.&#8221; The smile
that accompanied his words was good to see. But somehow
the gambler found the far horizon of more interest just then.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a wide one all right,&#8221; he said thoughtfully.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no gettin&#8217; upsides with you. Give me them quiet,
simple sort o&#8217; fellers every time. They got the gas machine
beat so far you couldn&#8217;t locate him with a forty-foot microscope.
Gee!&#8221; He chuckled, and turned again to contemplate
his companion, much as he would a newly discovered
wonder of the world.</p>
<p>But poor Scipio was really becoming distressed. He
hoped, merely because the other forced him to hope, by his
own evident sincerity. But the charge of shrewdness, of
conspiring to keep a secret he had never possessed, worried
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I take my oath I don&#8217;t know a thing, Bill,&#8221; he declared
earnestly. &#8220;I sure don&#8217;t. You&#8217;ve got to believe me, because
I can&#8217;t say more. I seen my claim days back, an&#8217; I
hadn&#8217;t a color. I ain&#8217;t seen it since. That&#8217;s fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was strange to see how readily the disbelief died out
of the other&#8217;s face. It was almost magical. It was as
though his previous expression had been nothing but acting
and his fresh attitude the result of studied preparation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Zip,&#8221; he said seriously, almost dejectedly, &#8220;if you
put it that way, I sure got to b&#8217;lieve you. But it&#8217;s queer. It
sure is. There&#8217;s folks ready to swear ther&#8217;s rich gold on
your claim, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll tell you right here I come along to git
in on it. Y&#8217;see, I&#8217;m a bizness man, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t figger to
git a crop o&#8217; weeds growin&#8217; around my feet. I sez to myself,
I sez, directly I heerd tell, &#8216;Here&#8217;s Zip with an elegant
patch o&#8217; pay dirt, an&#8217; here am I with a wad of bills handy,
which I&#8217;d sure like to turn over some.&#8217; Then I sez&ndash;&ndash;I want
you to understand jest how I thought&ndash;&ndash;I sez,&#8216;Mebbe I&#8217;ve
kind o&#8217; bin useful to Zip. Helped him out some, when he
was fixed awkward.&#8217; You see, it ain&#8217;t my way to do things
for nothing. An&#8217; I do allow I bin useful to you. Well, I
thought o&#8217; these things, so I come along right smart to get
in on the plum. Sez I, &#8216;Zip, bein&#8217; under obligation to me
some, mebbe he&#8217;ll let me buy ha&#8217;f share in his claim,&#8217; me
handin&#8217; him a thousand dollars. It &#8217;ud be a spot cash deal,
an&#8217; me puttin&#8217; in a feller to work&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; see things right fer
me&ndash;&ndash;why, I guess there&#8217;d be no chance o&#8217; you gettin&#8217; gay&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;
fakin&#8217; the output. See? I don&#8217;t guess you&#8217;re on the
crook, but in bizness a feller don&#8217;t take chances. Y&#8217;see I&#8217;m
pretty bright when it gits to bizness, an&#8217;, anyway, I don&#8217;t
stand fer no play o&#8217; that kind. Get me?&#8221;</p>
<p>The gambler&#8217;s manner was wholly severe as he explained
his proposition, and impressed his views of business. Scipio
listened without the slightest umbrage. He saw nothing
wrong, nothing unfriendly in the precautions the other had
intended to take. As a matter of fact, the one thing that
concerned him was the disappointment he must cause
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing like straight talk, Bill,&#8221; he said, cordially.
&#8220;I allus like straight talk. You kind of know just where
you are then. There&#8217;s not a doubt you&#8217;ve been real good
to me,&#8221; he went on, with evident feeling, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll
never be able to forget it&ndash;&ndash;never. I tell you right here, if
there was anything in the world I could do in return, I&#8217;d
do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled quaintly and pushed his stubby fingers through
his sparse hair in his most helpless manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there was gold on my claim, I&#8217;d let you in all you
need, and I wouldn&#8217;t want your dollars. Dollars? No,
Bill, I don&#8217;t want dollars for doing anything for you. I sure
don&#8217;t. I mean that. Maybe you&#8217;ll understand, y&#8217;see I&#8217;m
not a business man&ndash;&ndash;never was.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gambler averted his eyes. He could not look into
the other&#8217;s face so shining with honesty and gratitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there ain&#8217;t no gold found on that claim yet,&#8221; Scipio
went on. &#8220;Leastways, not that I know of, so what&#8217;s the
use deceivin&#8217; you? An&#8217; dollars, why, there&#8217;s no question of
&#8217;em between us. You can stand in ha&#8217;f my claim, Bill, an&#8217;
welcome, but you ain&#8217;t going to pay me dollars for gold that
ain&#8217;t been found. Yes, you&#8217;re sure welcome to ha&#8217;f my
claim, an&#8217; you ken set a man working for you. I&#8217;ll not say
but I&#8217;ll be glad of the help. But don&#8217;t make no mistake,
gold ain&#8217;t been found, as far as I know, an&#8217; there may be
none there, so I&#8217;d be glad if you don&#8217;t risk a lot of dollars
in the work.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gambler felt mean as he listened to the quiet words
ringing with such simple honesty. Time and again his beady
eyes lifted to the steady blue ones, only to drop quickly before
their fearless sincerity. He stirred irritably, and a hot
impatience with himself drove him so that the moment Scipio
finished speaking he broke out at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he cried, without the least gentleness, &#8220;you&#8217;re
talkin&#8217; a heap o&#8217; foolishness. I&#8217;m a bizness man offerin&#8217; a
bizness proposition. I don&#8217;t want nuthin&#8217; given. I&#8217;m out
to make a deal. You say there&#8217;s no gold there. Wal, I say
there sure is. That bein&#8217; so I&#8217;d be a low down skunk takin&#8217;
ha&#8217;f your claim fer nix, jest because you guess you owe me
things&ndash;&ndash;which I &#8217;low you sure do, speakin&#8217; plain. I got a
thousand dollars right here,&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he pulled out a packet of bills
from his hip pocket, and held them up for the other&#8217;s
inspection&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;an&#8217; them dollars says ther&#8217;s gold on your claim.
An&#8217; I&#8217;m yearnin&#8217; to touch ha&#8217;f that gold. But I&#8217;m takin&#8217; no
chances. I want it all wrote down reg&#8217;lar so folks can&#8217;t
say I sneaked around you, an&#8217; got it for nix. Gee, I&#8217;d look
mighty small if you turned around on me afterwards. No,
sir, you don&#8217;t get me that way. I&#8217;m only soft around my
teeth. If you&#8217;re the man I take you for, if you&#8217;re honest
as you&#8217;re guessin&#8217;, if you feel you want to pay me fer anything
I done for you, why, cut the gas an&#8217; take my dollars&#8217;
an&#8217; I&#8217;ll get the papers made out by a Spawn City lawyer.
They&#8217;re all that crooked they couldn&#8217;t walk a chalk-line, but
I guess they know how to bind a feller good an&#8217; tight, an&#8217;
I&#8217;ll see they bind you up so ther&#8217; won&#8217;t be no room for fool
tricks. That&#8217;s bizness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio shook his head. And Bill flushed angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t square,&#8221; the little man protested. &#8220;Maybe
you&#8217;ll lose your money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s up to me,&#8221; the gambler began fiercely. Then he
checked himself, and suddenly became quite grieved.
&#8220;Wal, Zip, I wouldn&#8217;t ha&#8217; b&#8217;lieved it. I sure wouldn&#8217;t. But
ther&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;life&#8217;s jest self. It&#8217;s all self. You&#8217;re like all the rest.
I&#8217;ve been chasin&#8217; a patch o&#8217; good pay dirt ever since I bin
around Sufferin&#8217; Creek, an&#8217; it&#8217;s only now I&#8217;ve found one to
suit me. I sure thought you&#8217;d let me in on it. I sure did.
Howsum, you won&#8217;t. You want it all yourself. Wall, go
ahead. An&#8217; you needn&#8217;t worry about what I told you this
morning. My word goes every time. This ain&#8217;t going to
make no difference. I&#8217;m not goin&#8217; to squeal on that jest
because you won&#8217;t &#8217;blige me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He made as though to return his dollars to his pocket.
He had turned away, but his shrewd eyes held his companion
in their focus. He saw the flush of shame on Scipio&#8217;s face.
He saw him open his mouth to speak. Then he saw it shut
as he left his tub and came towards him. Bill waited, his
cunning telling him to keep up his pretense. Scipio did not
pause till he laid a hand on his arm, and his mild eyes were
looking up into his keen, hard face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you can have ha&#8217;f my claim and&ndash;&ndash;and
I&#8217;ll take your dollars. I jest didn&#8217;t guess I was bein&#8217; selfish
about it&ndash;&ndash;I didn&#8217;t, truth. I was thinkin&#8217; o&#8217; you. I was
thinkin&#8217; you might lose your bills. Y&#8217;see, I haven&#8217;t had the
best of luck&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But the gambler&#8217;s face was a study as he pushed his hand
off and turned on him. There was a fine struggle going on
in his manner between the harshness he wished to display
and the glad triumph he really felt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t slob,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Here&#8217;s the bills. Stuff &#8217;em
right down in your dip. Ha&#8217;f that claim is mine, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll
have the papers wrote reg&#8217;lar. I didn&#8217;t think you was mean,
an&#8217; I&#8217;m glad you ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio took the money reluctantly enough, and pushed it
into his pocket with a sigh. But Bill had had enough of the
matter. He turned to go, moving hastily. Then, of a
sudden, he remembered. Thrusting his hand into a side
pocket of his jacket he produced a paper parcel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Zip, I come nigh forgettin&#8217;,&#8221; he cried cheerfully.
&#8220;The hash-slinger down at Minky&#8217;s ast me to hand you
this. It&#8217;s for the kiddies. It&#8217;s candy. I&#8217;d say she&#8217;s sweet
on your kiddies. She said I wasn&#8217;t to let you know she&#8217;d
sent &#8217;em. So you ken jest kep your face closed. So long.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hurried away like a man ashamed. Scipio had such
a way of looking into his eyes. But once out of sight he
slackened his pace. And presently a smile crept into his
small eyes, that set them twinkling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;m every kind of a fule,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;A
thousand dollars! Gee! An&#8217; ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t gold within a mile
of the doggone claim&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;cep&#8217; when Zip&#8217;s ther&#8217;,&#8221; he added
thoughtfully.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>HOW THE TRUST BOUGHT MEDICINE</h3>
</div>
<p>Wild Bill ate his supper that evening because it was his
custom to do so. He had no inclination for it, and it gave
him no enjoyment. He treated the matter much as he would
have treated the stoking of a stove on a winter&#8217;s night. So
long as he was filled up he cared little for the class of the
fuel.</p>
<p>Birdie waited on him with an attention and care such as
she never bestowed upon any other boarder at the store,
and the look in her bright eyes as she forestalled his wishes,
compared with the air with which she executed the
harshly delivered orders of the rest of the men, was quite
sufficient to enlighten the casual onlooker as to the state of
her romantic heart. But her blandishments were quite lost
upon our hero. He treated her with much the same sort of
indifference he might have displayed towards one of the
camp dogs.</p>
<p>To-night, particularly, nothing she could do or say seemed
to give him the least satisfaction. He ignored her as he
ignored all the rest of the boarders, and devoured his meal
in absolute silence&ndash;&ndash;in so far as any speech went&ndash;&ndash;wrapt
in an impenetrable moroseness which had a damping effect
upon the entire company.</p>
<p>Truth to tell, he was obsessed with his thoughts and feelings
against the man James. With every passing day his
resentment against him piled up, till now he could think of
nothing much else but a possible way to dislodge him from
the pinnacle of his local notoriety, and so rid the district of
the threat of his presence.</p>
<p>How much of this feeling was purely personal, inspired by
the natural antagonism of a strong, even violent, nature
against a man whose very existence was an everlasting challenge
to him, and how far it was the result of an unadmitted
sympathy for Scipio, it would have been impossible to tell in
a man like Wild Bill. Reason was not in such things with
him. He never sought reasons where his feelings were concerned.
James must go. And so his whole mind and force
was given up to a search for adequate means to accomplish
his purpose.</p>
<p>The problem was not easy. And when things were not
easy to him, Bill&#8217;s temper invariably suffered. Besides,
scheming was never pleasant to him. He was so essentially
a man of action. An open battle appealed to him as nothing
else in the world appealed to him. Force of arms&ndash;&ndash;that
was his conception of the settlement of human differences.</p>
<p>He admitted to himself that the events of the day had
stirred his &#8220;bile.&#8221; He felt that he must hit out to ease
himself, and the one direction to hit out in which would
have given him any satisfaction was not yet available. So
he brooded on, a smoldering volcano which his acquaintances
avoided with a care inspired by past experience.</p>
<p>But his mood was bound to find an outlet somehow. It
is always so. If the opportunity does not come naturally,
ill-temper will make one. It was this way with the gambler.
A devilish impulse caught him just as supper was nearing its
finish.</p>
<p>The thought occurred with the entrance of Sandy Joyce,
who took the empty place at the table on Bill&#8217;s right. Birdie
was hovering near, and, as Sandy took his seat, she suddenly
dumped a fresh cup of coffee before the gambler. She giggled
coyly as the cup clattered on the bare table.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t set sugar in it, Bill,&#8221; she said sweetly, and reached
towards the sugar-bowl.</p>
<p>But the man pushed her arm roughly aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, skip!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You make me sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>His bearishness in no way disconcerted the girl. She persisted,
and dropped two spoonfuls of granulated sugar into
his cup.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some folks need sugar,&#8221; she remarked, with another
giggle, as she moved away. And somehow it was Bill who
had suffered loss of dignity.</p>
<p>This only helped to aggravate his mood, and he turned his
small eyes sharply on Sandy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m needin&#8217; someone to work a claim fer me,&#8221; he said
in a voice intended to reach every ear, and as he spoke a
curious look came into his eyes. It was half a grin, half a
challenge, and wholly meant mischief.</p>
<p>The effect was exactly as he had calculated. The entire
attention of the room was on him at once, and he warmed
as he waited for Sandy&#8217;s reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you got a claim?&#8221; the widower inquired blankly.</p>
<p>Bill licked his lips after devouring a mouthful of pie.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; why in hell not?&#8221; he retorted.</p>
<p>Before Sandy could gather an adequate reply, the matter
was taken up by a young miner further down the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wher&#8217; you got it, Bill?&#8221; he inquired, with genuine
interest.</p>
<p>The gambler swallowed another mouthful of pie, and
rammed the rim of crust into his cheek with his thumb, and
leisurely devoured it before replying.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that my claim has anything to do wi&#8217; the
company present,&#8221; he said at last, with a dangerous look in
his half-grinning eyes. &#8220;But, seein&#8217; Mr. Joe Brand is kind
o&#8217; curious, guess he may as well know first as last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean no offense, Bill,&#8221; apologized the miner,
flushing and speaking hurriedly.</p>
<p>Bill promptly became sarcastic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Course you didn&#8217;t. Folks buttin&#8217; in never don&#8217;t mean no
offense. Howsum, guess my claim&#8217;s on the banks o&#8217; Sufferin&#8217;
Creek. Maybe you feel better now?&#8221; He glared down the
table, but finally turned again to Sandy. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t pertickler
busy &#8217;bout now, so&ndash;&ndash;ther&#8217;s thirty dollars a week says
you ken hev the job. An&#8217; I&#8217;ll give you a percentage o&#8217; the
gold you wash up,&#8221; he added dryly. &#8220;You on?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy nodded. He didn&#8217;t quite understand his friend&#8217;s
game. This was the first he had heard of Bill having
acquired a claim&ndash;&ndash;and on the river, too. There was only
one other man on the river, and&ndash;&ndash;well, Zip&#8217;s claim was the
joke of the camp.</p>
<p>He had just formulated a question in his mind, when the
words were taken out of his mouth by a heavy-faced prospector
further down the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wher&#8217; &#8217;bouts on the Creek, Bill?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>The gambler eyed him intently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite a piece up,&#8221; he said shortly.</p>
<p>A half-smile spread over the prospector&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not nigh&ndash;&ndash;Zip&#8217;s?&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>The half-grin in Bill&#8217;s eyes was becoming more savage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I bought it.&#8221;</p>
<p>His information increased the interest with a bound.
Every man there knew, or believed, that Zip&#8217;s claim was the
only one on the Creek.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know there was any other but Zip&#8217;s,&#8221; said Joe
Brand, his interest outrunning his discretion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you buttin&#8217; in again,&#8221; sneered Bill. &#8220;Guess you
know right, too. Ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was curious to glance down at the double row of faces
lining the table and note the perplexity which suddenly
gathered on them. Bill saw it and enjoyed it. It suited his
mood. Finally the heavy-faced prospector blurted out the
question that was in everybody&#8217;s mind, yet which the others
dared not ask.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you bought Zip&#8217;s claim?&#8221; he asked incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha&#8217;f of it. Me an&#8217; Zip&#8217;s partners. You got anything
to say?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill&#8217;s words rapped out with biting force, and Sandy,
knowing the man, waited, solemn-eyed. Just for one moment
astonishment held his audience breathless. Then some
one sniggered, and it became the cue for an instantaneous
and general guffaw of derision. Every face was wreathed
in a broad grin. The humor of this thing was too much.
Zip&#8217;s claim! Bill, the keen, unscrupulous gambler, had fallen
for Zip&#8217;s mud-hole on the banks of Suffering Creek!</p>
<p>Bill waited. The laugh was what he needed, so he waited
till it died out. As it did so he kicked back his chair and
stood up, his tall figure and hard face a picture of cold
challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re that merry, folks,&#8221; he said, his teeth clipping each
word, &#8220;that maybe some o&#8217; you got something to say. I&#8217;d
like to hear it. No?&#8221; as he waited. But no one seemed
anxious to comment. &#8220;Joe Brand kind o&#8217; seems fond o&#8217;
buttin&#8217; in&ndash;&ndash;mebbe he&#8217;ll oblige.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the young miner was not to be drawn. Bill shrugged
his lean shoulders, his fierce eyes alight with a dangerous
fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I don&#8217;t guess I ken make folks talk
if they don&#8217;t notion it. But I want to say right here I bought
ha&#8217;f o&#8217; Zip&#8217;s claim fer good dollars, an&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to pay
Sandy Joyce a tiptop wage fer workin&#8217; my share. An&#8217;&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he
paused and glanced swiftly and defiantly at the faces
which were no longer smiling&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;an&#8217; I want to say I bought
the richest lay-out in this bum camp. Any feller who ain&#8217;t
o&#8217; the same opinion ken git right up on to his hind legs an&#8217;
call me a &#8216;liar&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I&#8217;m jest yearnin&#8217; fer some feller to git
around an&#8217; call me that. Jest turn it over in your fool heads.
You don&#8217;t need to hurry any. Ther&#8217;s days an&#8217; days to come,
an&#8217; at any time I&#8217;ll be glad fer all o&#8217; you to come along an&#8217;
tell me I&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;a liar.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, his fierce eyes gleaming. He felt good. His
outburst had relieved his pent feelings. It was a safety-valve
which had worked satisfactorily at the right moment.
But as he received no answer to his challenge he turned
to Sandy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217; don&#8217;t seem to be nuthin&#8217; doin&#8217;,&#8221; he said, with a
grim smile. &#8220;So ef you&#8217;ll come right along we&#8217;ll fix
things out in the store. Guess you ken finish your hash
after.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy rose. For a moment Bill did not attempt to move.
It was as though he were giving the rest of the boarders one
last chance of accepting his challenge. But as no one offered
any comment or made any attempt to stay him, he turned
away at last with a sigh which was probably of disappointment,
and led the way out into the store.</p>
<p>But if the men had made no comment in his presence, it
was a different matter after his departure. Loud indignation
broke out, and fierce, if impotent, protest passed from
lip to lip. It was only for a few moments, however, and
presently anger gave place to a realization of the absurdity
of the whole thing.</p>
<p>The humor of these men was tickled. The whole thing
was too ludicrous for words. To think that Wild Bill, the
renowned sharp, the shrewdest, the wisest man on Suffering
Creek, had fallen for such a proposition! It was certainly
the funniest, the best joke that had ever come their way.
How had it happened? they asked each other. Had Zip
been clever enough to &#8220;salt&#8221; his claim? It was hardly
likely. Only they knew he was hard up, and it was just
possible, with his responsibilities weighing heavily on him,
he had resorted to an illicit practice to realize on his property.
They thought of and discussed every possible means
they could think of by which Bill could have been lured to
the hook&ndash;&ndash;and caught&ndash;&ndash;and landed. That was the joke.
It was astounding. It was too good. To-morrow the whole
camp would be ringing with laughter at the news, but&ndash;&ndash;but
the laughter was not likely to reach the gambler&#8217;s
ears.</p>
<p>In the meantime it was quite a different man who was
lounging over Minky&#8217;s counter talking to Sandy and the
storekeeper. Bill had relieved the pressure of his mood for
the moment, and now, like a momentarily exhausted volcano,
he was enjoying the calm of reaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll need you to start work right away,&#8221; he was saying,
&#8220;an&#8217; you ken draw on me fer all the supplies you need. It&#8217;s
a dandy claim,&#8221; he went on grimly, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t know fer
sure what you&#8217;ll likely find on it. Maybe you&#8217;ll find suthin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;if
you work long enough. Anyways, you&#8217;ll start by
sinkin&#8217; a shaft; an&#8217; you&#8217;ll kep on sinkin&#8217; it till&ndash;&ndash;till I tell you
to quit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that ain&#8217;t the regular way gold&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, whose claim is it? Am I payin&#8217; you or not?&#8221;
demanded the gambler sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure you are, but you said it was the richest&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was back ther&#8217; at supper,&#8221; said Bill coldly.
&#8220;Guess supper&#8217;s over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy had no quickness of understanding. He did not
appreciate the fineness of the distinction. He shook his
head solemnly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I ain&#8217;t jest bright enuff to foller&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t,&#8221; agreed Bill shortly.</p>
<p>He winked at Minky, who was listening interestedly.
Then he turned abruptly and pointed at the array of patent
medicines adorning one of the shelves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;&#8217;bout them physics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minky turned and gazed affectionately at the shelf. It
was the pride of his store. He always kept it well dusted
and dressed. The delicate wrappings and fancy labels always
had a strong fascination for him. Then there were the
curative possibilities of the contents of the inviting packages
as set forth by the insistent &#8220;drummer&#8221; who sold them to
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;An elegant stock,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Sort of concentrated
health.&#8221; Then he glanced round anxiously. &#8220;Your
hosses ain&#8217;t ailin&#8217;?&#8221; he inquired. &#8220;I got most everything
fer hosses. Ther&#8217;s embrocation, hoss iles, every sort of lin&#8217;ments.
Hoss balls? Linseed?&#8221;</p>
<p>The gambler shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t got physic fer men-folk?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure have. But&ndash;&ndash;but you ain&#8217;t sick?&#8221; Minky eyed
his friend narrowly.</p>
<p>Bill&#8217;s mouth twisted wryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t jest sick,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;But,&#8221; he added hopefully,
&#8220;you can&#8217;t never be sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minky nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. I&#8217;d say you don&#8217;t look a heap sick, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You sure don&#8217;t,&#8221; agreed Sandy. &#8220;But, as you sez,
you can&#8217;t never tell. Now, you buyin&#8217; ha&#8217;f Zip&#8217;s claim
makes&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; His words died down to a thoughtful murmur.
Bill&#8217;s look was somehow discouraging as he pointed at the
medicine.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you got?&#8221; he demanded abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, most everything,&#8221; said Minky. &#8220;Ther&#8217;, you see
that longish bottle? That&#8217;s a dandy cough cure. Guess
you ain&#8217;t needin&#8217; that? No? Ah!&#8221; as Bill shook his head,
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t guess you&#8217;d a cough. Corns? Now, this yer
packet is an elegant fixin&#8217; fer corns, soft an&#8217; hard. It jest
kills &#8217;em stone dead, sure. It&#8217;s bully stuff, but &#8217;tain&#8217;t good
fer eatin&#8217;. You ain&#8217;t got corns?&#8221; he inquired, as Bill again
shook his head. &#8220;Ah, seems a pity.&#8221; He turned again to
the shelf, determined, if possible, to suit his customer, and
lifted down a number of packets and sealed bottles. &#8220;Now,
here,&#8221; he cried, holding up a dainty box tied up with a
delicate-colored ribbon. For a moment his audience believed
it to be candy, but he quickly undeceived them. &#8220;Now this
yer is dandy truck, though I don&#8217;t guess ther&#8217;s a heap o&#8217; use
fer it on Suffering Creek. It&#8217;s fer softening alkali water.
When the drummer told me that, I guessed to him ther
wa&#8217;an&#8217;t a heap o&#8217; water drunk in this camp. But he said it
wa&#8217;an&#8217;t fer drinkin&#8217; water; it was fer baths. I kind o&#8217; told
him that wouldn&#8217;t help the sale any, so he said it could be
used fer washin&#8217;. Seein&#8217; he couldn&#8217;t sell me any that way
neither, he got riled an&#8217; give me a present of it, an&#8217; said he
guessed Sufferin&#8217; Creek <i>did</i> use water fer washing gold.
Y&#8217;see, its price is a dollar an&#8217; a ha&#8217;f, but, seein&#8217; it&#8217;s kind o&#8217;
dead stock, you ken have it a present.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill took it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mine,&#8221; he said. And Sandy watched him with some
concern.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; a bath?&#8221; he inquired nervously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk foolish,&#8221; cried Bill, and turned again to his
scrutiny of the shelf. &#8220;What else you got? Any stummick
physic?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221; Minky held up a small bottle of tabloids.
&#8220;Camel-hell,&#8221; he said, with the assurance of a man who
knows the worth of the article he is offering for sale.
&#8220;Now this yer is Camel-hell&ndash;&ndash;C-a-l-o-m-e-l. And I&#8217;d sure
say the name is appropriate. That doggone &#8216;drummer&#8217; feller
said ther&#8217; was enough in one o&#8217; them bottles to kep the
stummicks of a whole blamed menagerie right fer six
months. It&#8217;s real dandy&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off suddenly, and his look of enthusiasm was
abruptly replaced by one of anxious interest that bordered
closely on apprehension. His audience realized the change,
and both men glanced swiftly in the direction whence the
storekeeper&#8217;s gaze had become so suddenly concentrated.
Instantly they became aware that two strangers had quietly
entered the store, and had taken their places at one of the
tables under the open window.</p>
<p>Bill thought he recognized one of the men, but was not
sure where he had seen him. Sandy saw nothing remarkable
in their presence, and at once turned back to the counter.</p>
<p>&#8220;More of &#8217;em,&#8221; said Minky in a low tone, when finally
Bill turned back to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Many while I bin away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Four or five. All&ndash;&ndash;come along fer a game&ndash;&ndash;it seems.&#8221;
Minky&#8217;s eyes were brooding.</p>
<p>Suddenly a light of intelligence sprang into Bill&#8217;s thoughtful
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I remember one o&#8217; them. I see him in Spawn City&ndash;&ndash;in
a bum gamblin&#8217; dive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy suddenly roused to a keen interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Them strangers,&#8221; he said&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;that &#8217;minds me I was
talkin&#8217; to one last night. He was askin&#8217; me when a stage
was running from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;you tell him?&#8221; demanded Bill quickly, and
Minky&#8217;s eyes asked the question too.</p>
<p>Sandy laughed conceitedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure said ther&#8217; wa&#8217;an&#8217;t no stages runnin&#8217;, with James&#8217;
gang around. I wa&#8217;an&#8217;t goin&#8217; to give nuthin&#8217; away to
strangers. Y&#8217;see, if I&#8217;d pretended we was sendin&#8217; out stages,
we&#8217;d have that gang hangin&#8217; around waitin&#8217;. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t no use
in gatherin&#8217; wasps around a m&#8217;lasses-pot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. You didn&#8217;t tell him nuthin&#8217; else?&#8221; Bill inquired,
eyeing him shrewdly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did that,&#8221; said Sandy triumphantly. &#8220;I filled him up
good. I jest told him we was wise to James an&#8217; his gang,
an&#8217; was takin&#8217; no chances, seein&#8217; Sufferin&#8217; Creek was such a
rich lay-out. I told him we was bankin&#8217; up the gold right
here, an&#8217; holdin&#8217; it till the pile was so big we could claim a
Gover&#8217;ment escort that could snap their fingers at James an&#8217;
his lay-out.&#8221;</p>
<p>A swift exchange of glances passed between the gambler
and the storekeeper. And then, in a quiet voice, Bill demanded&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing o&#8217; consequence,&#8221; replied Sandy, feeling he had
acquitted himself well. &#8220;He jest asted if Minky here
banked the stuff, an&#8217; I &#8217;lowed he did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; There was an ominous sparkle in Bill&#8217;s eyes as
he breathed his ejaculation. Then, with a quiet sarcasm
quite lost on the obtuse widower, &#8220;You&#8217;d make an elegant
sheriff&#8217;s officer. You&#8217;d raise hell with the crooks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy appeared pleased with what he took for praise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d show &#8217;em some&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Bill had turned to the storekeeper.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to git doin&#8217;. I&#8217;ve heerd a heap in Spawn
City. Anyway, it was bound to git around. What he&#8217;s
said don&#8217;t matter a heap. What I&#8217;ve heerd tells me we&#8217;ve
got to git busy quick. We&#8217;ve got to clean you out of&ndash;&ndash;stuff,
or ther&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be a most outrageous unhealthy time
on Sufferin&#8217; Creek. We&#8217;ll fix things to-morrer. Bein&#8217; Sunday,&#8221;
he added grimly, &#8220;it&#8217;ll be an elegant day fer settin&#8217;
things right. Meanwhiles, I&#8217;ll ast you to fix me a parcel o&#8217;
them physics, jest some of each, an&#8217; you ken git Sunny Oak
to pass &#8217;em right on to Zip fer his kids. Guess they&#8217;ll worry
out how best to dose &#8217;em right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minky nodded, but his eyes were gloomily watching the
two strangers sitting under the window. Sandy, however,
suddenly brightened into a wide smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he cried delightedly, slapping his thigh in his
exuberance. &#8220;That&#8217;s it. Course. It&#8217;s all writ in the reg&#8217;lations
fer raisin&#8217; them kids. Gee! you had me beat clear to
death. Physic ev&#8217;ry Saturday night. Blamed if this ain&#8217;t
Saturday&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; t&#8217;-morrer&#8217;s Sunday. An&#8217; I tho&#8217;t you was
sufferin&#8217; and needed physic. Say&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Bill, too, was watching the strangers with interested
eyes. He was paying no sort of attention to this wonderful
discovery of his bright friend.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>SCIPIO MAKES PREPARATIONS</h3>
</div>
<p>Scipio&#8217;s impulses were, from his own point of view,
entirely practical. Whatever he did, he did with his whole
heart. And if his results somehow missed coming out as
he intended them, it was scarcely his fault. Rather was it
the misfortune of being burdened with a superfluous energy,
supported by inadequate thought.</p>
<p>And he felt something of this as he sat in his living-room
and glanced round him at the unaccountable disorder that
maintained. It was Sunday morning, and all his spare time
in his home on Saturday had been spent in cleaning and
scrubbing and putting straight, and yet&ndash;&ndash;and yet&ndash;&ndash;He
passed a stubby hand across his forehead, as though to brush
aside the vision of the confusion he beheld.</p>
<p>He knew everything was wrong, and a subconscious feeling
told him that he had no power to put things right. It
was curious, too. Every utensil, every stick of furniture,
the floor, the stove, everything had been scrubbed and
garnished at a great expense of labor. Everything had been
carefully bestowed in the place which, to his mind, seemed
most suited for its disposal. Yet now, as he gazed about
him at the result, he knew that only a cleanly untidiness
prevailed, and he felt disheartened.</p>
<p>Look at the children&#8217;s clean clothes, carefully folded with
almost painful exactness; yet they were like a pile of rags
just thrown together. And their unironed condition added
to the illusion. Every cooking-pot and pan had been cleaned
and polished, yet, to his eyes, the litter of them suggested
one of the heaps of iron scraps out on the dumps. How
was it every piece of china looked forlornly suggestive of
a wanderer without a home? No, he did not know. He
had done his very best, and yet everything seemed to need
just that magic touch to give his home the requisite well-cared-for
air.</p>
<p>He was disappointed, and his feelings were plainly to be
perceived in the regretful glance of his pale eyes. For some
moments his optimistic energy rose and prompted him to begin
all over again, but he denied himself this satisfaction as
he glanced through the window at the morning sun. It was
too high up in the sky. There was other work yet before
him, with none too much time for its performance before
the midday meal.</p>
<p>Instead, he turned to the &#8220;regulations&#8221; which Sunny Oak
had furnished him with, and, with an index finger following
out the words, he read down the details of the work for
Sunday&ndash;&ndash;in so far as his twins were concerned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he murmured, &#8220;I got the wash done yesterday.
It says here Monday. That&#8217;s kind of a pity.&#8221; Then he
brightened into hopefulness. &#8220;Guess I kin do those things
again Monday. I sort o&#8217; fancy they could do with another
wash &#8217;fore the kiddies wear them. I never could wash
clothes right, first time. Now, Sunday.&#8221; His finger passed
slowly from one detail to another. &#8220;Breakfast&ndash;&ndash;yes.
Bath. Ah, guess that comes next. Now, &#8217;bout that bath.&#8221;
He glanced anxiously round him. Then he turned back to
the regulations. &#8220;It don&#8217;t say whether hot or cold,&#8221; he
muttered disappointedly.</p>
<p>For a moment he stood perplexed. Then he began to
reason the matter out with himself. It was summer. For
grown-ups it would naturally be a cold bath, but he was not
so sure about children. They were very young, and it
would be so easy for them to take cold, he thought. No, it
had best be hot. He would cook some water. This thought
prompting him, he set the saucepan on the stove and stirred
the fire.</p>
<p>He was turning back to his regulations, when it occurred
to him that he must now find something to bathe the children
in. Glancing about amongst the few pots he possessed, he
realized that the largest saucepan, or &#8220;billy,&#8221; in the house
would not hold more than a gallon of water. No, these
were no use, for though he exercised all his ingenuity he
could see no way of bathing the children in any of them.
Once during his cogitations he was very nearly inspired. It
flashed through his mind that he might stand each child outside
of a couple of pots and wash them all over that way.
But he quickly negatived the thought. That wasn&#8217;t his idea
of a bath. They must sit <i>in</i> the water.</p>
<p>He was about to give the matter up in despair, when, in a
moment of inspiration, he remembered the washing-tub. Of
course, that was the very thing. They could both sit in that
together. It was down at the river, but he could easily fetch
it up.</p>
<p>So he turned again in relief to the regulations. What
next? He found his place, and read the directions out
slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;After their bath kids needs an hour&#8217;s Bible talk.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>He read it again. And then a third time, so as to make
quite sure. Then he turned thoughtfully to the door, staring
out at the bright sunlight beyond. He could hear the children&#8217;s
voices as they played outside, but he was not heeding
them. He was delving around in a hazy recollection of
Bible subjects, which he vaguely remembered having studied
when a child.</p>
<p>It was difficult&ndash;&ndash;very difficult. But he was not beaten.
There were several subjects that occurred to him in scraps.
There was Noah. Then there was Moses. He recalled
something of Solomon, and he knew that David slew a giant.</p>
<p>But none of these subjects amounted to more than a dim
recollection. Of details he knew none. Worked into a
thorough muddle with his worry, he was almost despairing
again when suddenly he remembered that Jessie possessed
a Bible. Perhaps it was still in the bedroom. He would go
and see. It would surely help him. So he promptly went
in search of it, and, in a few moments, was sitting down
beside the table poring over it and studiously preparing
himself for his forthcoming tutelary duties.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>SUNDAY MORNING IN SUFFERING CREEK</h3>
</div>
<p>On the veranda of the store was the usual Sunday morning
gathering of the citizens of Suffering Creek, an impromptu
function which occurred as regularly as the sun rose
and set. Some of the men were clad in their best black
broadcloth, resplendent, if shiny at the seams, and bespotted
with drink and tobacco stains. But the majority had made
no such effort to differentiate between the seventh day of the
week and the other six. The only concession that everyone
yielded, and then with bad enough grace in many instances,
was to add to the boredom of their day of rest by performing
a scanty ablution in the washing trough at the back of the
store.</p>
<p>Minky was one of the few who clung to the customs of
his up-bringing. He was there, ample, and gayly beaming,
in &#8220;boiled&#8221; shirt, and a highly colored vest, which clashed
effusively with his brilliantly variegated bow-tie, but of
which he was inordinately proud.</p>
<p>It was the custom at these meetings to discuss any matters
which affected the well-being of the community, to listen
to any item of interest pointing the prosperity of the local
gold industry, to thresh out complaints. In fact, it became
a sort of Local Government Board, of which the storekeeper
was president, and such men as Wild Bill, Sandy Joyce and
one or two of the more successful miners formed the
governing committee.</p>
<p>But it was yet comparatively early, and many sore heads
were still clinging to their rough pillows. Saturday night
was always a heavy occasion, and the Sunday morning
sleep was a generally acknowledged necessity. However,
this did not prevent discussion amongst those already
assembled.</p>
<p>Wild Bill was not there. Sandy Joyce was still absent,
although both had been long since stirring. Someone sarcastically
suggested that they had gone off to inspect the
gambler&#8217;s rich strike before Sandy got to work on it on the
morrow. This drew a great laugh at Wild Bill&#8217;s expense.
And it was only the loyal Minky&#8217;s voice that checked it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;se fellers are laffin&#8217;,&#8221; he said, in good-humored
reproval. &#8220;Wal, laff. I can&#8217;t say I know why Bill&#8217;s bo&#8217;t
that claim, but I&#8217;ll say this: I&#8217;d a heap sooner foller his
money than any other man&#8217;s. I&#8217;ve sure got a notion we best
do our laffin&#8217; right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; agreed Joe Brand reluctantly. &#8220;Bill&#8217;s a
cur&#8217;us feller. He&#8217;s so mighty cur&#8217;us I ain&#8217;t got much use
for him&ndash;&ndash;personal. But I&#8217;ll say right here, he&#8217;s wide
enough to beat most any feller at any bluff he&#8217;s got savvee to
put up. Howsum, every &#8216;smart&#8217; falls fer things at times.
Y&#8217;see, they get lookin&#8217; fer rich strikes that hard, an&#8217; are so
busy keppin&#8217; other folks out o&#8217; them, it&#8217;s dead easy gettin&#8217;
&#8217;em trippin&#8217;. Guess that tow-headed sucker, Zip, &#8217;s got him
trippin&#8217; about now, sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minky shook his head. He did not believe it. If Bill
had been caught napping, he must have willfully gone to
sleep. He knew the man too well. However, he had no
intention of arguing the matter with these people. So he
turned away and stood staring out at the far distance beyond
the creek.</p>
<p>In a few moments the whole matter was dismissed from
his mind, and his thoughts filled with a something that lately
had become a sort of obsession to him. It was the safety of
his gold-dust that troubled, and as each day passed his apprehensions
grew. He felt that trouble was threatening in the
air of Suffering Creek, and the thought of how easily he
might be taken at a disadvantage worried him terribly. He
knew that it was imperative for him to unload his gold.
But how? How could it be done in safety, in the light of
past events? It was suicidal to send it off to Spawn City
on a stage, with the James gang watching the district. And
the Government&ndash;&ndash;?</p>
<p>Suddenly his eyes lit excitedly. He pointed out across the
creek with startling abruptness, in a direction where the land
sloped gradually upwards towards the more distant foothills,
in a broken carpet of pine woods. He was indicating a rift
in the forest, where, for a long stretch, a wide clearing had
been made by the axes of the pioneers of the camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho, fellers!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Get a peek yonder. Who&#8217;s
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>In an instant every eye followed the direction of his outstretched
arm. And the men stood silently watching the
progress of a horseman racing headlong through the clearing
and making for the creek in front of them as fast as his
horse could lay legs to the ground. So silent and intent
did the group on the veranda become, that faint, yet sharply
distinct, even at that distance, the thrashing of the horse&#8217;s
hoofs floated to their straining ears on the still morning air,
and set them wondering.</p>
<p>On came the man at a furious pace. He was leaning far
over his horse&#8217;s neck, so that the whole weight of his body
was well clear of the saddle. And as he came the waiting
men could plainly see the rise and fall of his arm, as he
mercilessly flogged his straining beast. It was Joe Brand
who first broke the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like Sid Morton,&#8221; he hazarded. &#8220;I kind o&#8217;
seem to mind his sorrel with four white legs. He&#8217;s comin&#8217;
from the right direction, too. Guess his ranch is ten miles
up yonder. Say, he&#8217;s makin&#8217; a hell of a bat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He sure is.&#8221; Jim Wright, the oldest miner in the camp,
blinked his red-rimmed eyes as they watered with the strain
of watching, &#8220;It&#8217;s trouble that&#8217;s chasin&#8217; him,&#8221; he added,
with conviction. &#8220;Trouble o&#8217; some kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort o&#8217; trouble?&#8221; Minky spoke half to himself.
Just now there was only one idea of trouble in his
mind.</p>
<p>Somebody laughed foolishly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t many sorts o&#8217; trouble sets a man chasin&#8217;
like that,&#8221; said a voice in the background.</p>
<p>Minky glanced round.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are they, Van?&#8221; he inquired, and turned back
again to his scrutiny of the on-coming horseman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sickness, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;guns,&#8221; replied the man addressed as
Van, with another foolish laugh. &#8220;If it&#8217;s Sid he ain&#8217;t got
anybody out on his ranch to be sick, &#8217;cep&#8217; his two &#8217;punchers.
An&#8217; I don&#8217;t guess he&#8217;d chase for them. Must be &#8216;guns.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>No one answered him. Everybody was too intent on the
extraordinary phenomenon. The man was nearing the
creek. In a few seconds he would be hidden from view,
for the opposite bank lay far below them, cut off from
sight by the height of the rising ground intervening on the
hither side.</p>
<p>A moment later a distinct movement amongst the
watchers, which had something almost of relief in it, told
that this had happened. Minky turned to Jim Wright, who
chanced to be nearest him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Sid,&#8221; he declared definitely.</p>
<p>The old man nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I guess Van&#8217;s right,&#8221; he agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be along up in a minute,&#8221; said Joe Brand.</p>
<p>Minky remained where he was watching the point at
which he expected to see the horseman reappear. This sudden
apparition had fastened itself upon his general apprehension
and become part of it. What was the news the man
was bringing?</p>
<p>Some of the men moved off the veranda to meet the horseman
when he came up, but the majority remained where
they were. In spite of their interest, these people were
rarely carried away by their feelings in a matter of this sort.
Time would tell them all they wanted to know. Perhaps
a good deal more than they cared to hear. So they preferred
to wait.</p>
<p>Their patience was quickly rewarded. In less than five
minutes a bobbing head rose above the brow of the incline.
Then came the man. He was still leaning forward to ease
his panting horse, whose dilated nostrils and flattened ears
told the onlookers of its desperate journey. The leg-weary
beast floundered up the steep under quirt and spur&ndash;&ndash;and,
in a moment, stood tottering, gasping and steaming before
the eager crowd.</p>
<p>Sid Morton almost fell out of the saddle. And as his feet
came to the ground he reeled. But Minky caught him, and
he steadied himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m beat,&#8221; the horseman cried desperately. &#8220;For
mercy&#8217;s sake hand me a horn o&#8217; whisky.&#8221;</p>
<p>He flung himself down on the edge of the veranda, leaving
his jaded beast to anyone&#8217;s care. He was too far spent to
think of anything or anybody but himself. Falling back
against the post he closed his eyes while the silent crowd
looked on stupidly.</p>
<p>Minky seemed to be the only one who fully grasped the
situation. He passed the foundered horse on to his
&#8220;choreman,&#8221; and then himself procured a stiff drink of rye
whisky for the exhausted man. This he administered
without a moment&#8217;s delay, and the ranchman opened his
eyes.</p>
<p>The next instant he sat up, and, in doing so, disclosed a
large dark-red patch on the post he had leaned against.
Minky saw the ominous stain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wounded?&#8221; he inquired sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some.&#8221; Then he added, after a moment&#8217;s hesitation,
&#8220;Yes, guess I&#8217;m done.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ranchman spoke rapidly. For the moment at least
his weakness seemed to have passed, and the weariness to
have gone out of his eyes and voice. He strained eagerly,
his eyes alight and bloodshot. The whisky had given him
momentary courage, momentary strength; the drawn lines of
rapidly draining life had smoothed out of his young cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, listen,&#8221; he cried, almost fiercely. &#8220;I&#8217;m beat. I
know. But&ndash;&ndash;but I want to tell you things. You needn&#8217;t
to notice that hole in my back.&#8221; He writhed painfully.
&#8220;Guess they&ndash;&ndash;they got my lung or&ndash;&ndash;or somethin&#8217;. Y&#8217;see,
it&#8217;s the James gang. Some of &#8217;em are&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;a spasm of pain
shot athwart his face as he hesitated&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;&#8217;bout three miles
back ther&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point a terrible fit of coughing interrupted him,
and blood trickled into the corners of his mouth. Minky
understood. He dispatched one of the bystanders for some
brandy, while he knelt down to the man&#8217;s support. At once
the drooping body sagged heavily upon his arm; but when
the paroxysm had passed the weight lightened, and the dying
man hurried on with his story, although his voice had lost
more than half of its former ring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t much time,&#8221; he said, with something like a
gasp. &#8220;He&#8217;s run off my stock, an&#8217; set my hay an&#8217; the corrals
afire. He&ndash;&ndash;he got us when we was roundin&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;roundin&#8217;
up a bunch o&#8217; steers. Y&#8217;see&ndash;&ndash;y&#8217;see, we was in&ndash;&ndash;in
the saddle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again he paused. This time his breath came in gasps and
deep-throated gurglings. He struggled on, however, stumbling
and gasping with almost every second word.</p>
<p>&#8220;We put up a&ndash;&ndash;scrap&ndash;&ndash;good. An&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; both&ndash;&ndash;my
boys was&ndash;&ndash;was dropped cold. After I&ndash;&ndash;I emptied&ndash;&ndash;my
gun&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;I hit&ndash;&ndash;the trail for here. Then I&ndash;&ndash;got it good.
Say&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more he was interrupted by a fit of terrible coughing.
And the moment it eased the storekeeper held the
brandy, which one of the boys had brought, to his blood-flecked
lips. The poor fellow&#8217;s end was not far off. The
onlookers knew it. Minky knew there was practically nothing
to be done for him. All these men had witnessed the
approach of death in this form too often before. A lung
pierced by a bullet! They could do nothing but look on
curiously, helplessly and listen carefully to the story he was
trying to tell.</p>
<p>The man struggled with himself for some moments. The
strong young body was yielding reluctantly enough to the
death-grip. And at last his words gasped haltingly upon the
still air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their plugs&ndash;&ndash;wasn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;fresh. Mine&ndash;&ndash;was. That
give&ndash;&ndash;me&ndash;&ndash;the&ndash;&ndash;legs&ndash;&ndash;of &#8217;em. But&ndash;&ndash;they&ndash;&ndash;rode&ndash;&ndash;hard,
an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice died down to a whistling gasp and his eyes
closed. He was sinking fast. Minky forced more brandy
between his lips. And presently the drooping eyelids
widened, and a momentary strength lifted the weakening
body.</p>
<p>&#8220;They follered,&#8221; he mumbled, &#8220;but&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;know&ndash;&ndash;how&ndash;&ndash;many.
&#8217;Bout&ndash;&ndash;three. Three&ndash;&ndash;miles&ndash;&ndash;back&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;lost&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;em&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes were glazing and staring painfully. And as his
last words hovered on his lips they were drowned by the
gurgling and rattling in his throat. Suddenly a shudder
passed through his frame. He started, his eyes staring
wildly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;done!&#8221; he gasped. His arms shot up convulsively,
his legs flung out. And then all his weight dropped
back on to the storekeeper&#8217;s supporting arm. The next
moment his body seemed to heave as with a deep, restful
sigh, and his head lolled helplessly forward. He was dead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>A BATH AND&ndash;&ndash;</h3>
</div>
<p>Scipio started and looked up as a joyous greeting from
the children outside warned him of the approach of a visitor.
He was rather glad of the interruption, too. He found the
Bible offered him such an enormous field of research. It
was worse than enormous; it was overwhelming. The
Bible was really more than he could study in the few minutes
he had allowed himself. As yet he had not found even
one single mention of the few subjects he still retained a
vague recollection of.</p>
<p>As he glanced at the doorway it was darkened by a familiar
figure. Sunny Oak, as ragged, disreputable and unclean
as usual, smiled himself into the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy, Zip?&#8221; he greeted genially. &#8220;Guessed I&#8217;d git
around, seem&#8217; it was Sunday. Y&#8217;see, folks don&#8217;t work any
Sunday. I&#8217;d sure say it&#8217;s a real blessin&#8217; folks is &#8217;lowed to
rest one day in seven. Talkin&#8217; o&#8217; work, I heerd tell you&#8217;ve
took a pardner to your claim. Wild Bill&#8217;s smart. He ain&#8217;t
bluffed you any?&#8221;</p>
<p>The loafer seated himself in the other chair with an air
of utter weariness. He might just have finished a spell of
the most arduous labor, instead of having merely strolled
across the dumps. Scipio smiled faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t bluffed me any,&#8221; he said gently. &#8220;Seems to
me he wouldn&#8217;t bluff me. Yes, he&#8217;s in on ha&#8217;f my claim.
Y&#8217;see, he thinks ther&#8217;s gold in sight, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I know ther&#8217;
ain&#8217;t. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s troubling me. I kind of feel mean
some.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny yawned luxuriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry any,&#8221; he said easily. &#8220;Bill&#8217;s mighty
wide. If he&#8217;s come in on your claim he&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;needin&#8217; to bad.
Say&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off and turned alertly to the door. A sound of
voices reached them, and a moment later Sandy Joyce and
Toby stood grinning in the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; cried Sunny. &#8220;Gettin&#8217; quite a party.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m real pleased you folks come along,&#8221; Scipio declared
warmly. He stood up and looked round uncertainly.
&#8220;Say,&#8221; he went on, his pale face flushing a little ruefully,
&#8220;come right in, boys. I don&#8217;t see jest where you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to
sit. Maybe the table&#8217;s good an&#8217; strong. This chair&#8217;ll
do for one.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Toby would have none of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Set you down, Zip,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I got this doorway.
Guess the table&#8217;ll fit Sandy. He&#8217;s kind o&#8217; high in his notions.
I jest see Bill comin&#8217; along up from the river.
Looked like he was comin&#8217; this way. How&#8217;s the kids?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, bully,&#8221; said Scipio amiably. &#8220;Y&#8217;see, I got &#8217;em
fixed right all right since Sunny wrote out those regulations
for me. Those regulations are jest dandy, and I&#8217;m desperate
obliged to him. A feller would need to be a bum
sort of fool, anyhow, who couldn&#8217;t fix kids right with it all
set out so careful. There sure are things set down there I&#8217;d
never have thought of&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I&#8217;m their father, too.&#8221; He
paused and glanced nervously round at the friendly faces.
Then, with evident anxiety, he hurried on. &#8220;I was just
thinkin&#8217;,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;maybe some hot coffee wouldn&#8217;t
come amiss. Y&#8217;see, I ain&#8217;t no rye. Guess I&#8217;ll make that
coffee right away. I got water cooking on the stove. I
was goin&#8217; to use it for bathin&#8217; the kids, but&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His visitors exchanged swift glances, and Sunny broke in.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t do it, Zip,&#8221; he said with an amiable grin. &#8220;These
boys don&#8217;t figger to unpickle their vitals with no sech truck
as coffee. Say&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;his eyes wandered to where his carefully
written regulations were posted, &#8220;talkin&#8217; o&#8217; baths, have you
physicked the kids right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio, feeling somewhat relieved, returned to his chair
and lodged himself upon its edge. He could not settle himself
at his ease. Somehow he felt that these men were entirely
his superior in all those things which count for manhood;
and the kindness of such a visit rather overwhelmed
him. Then, too, he was sincerely regretting his inadequate
hospitality. Now he became nervously enthusiastic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure did,&#8221; he cried eagerly. &#8220;Those physics were real
elegant. If you&#8217;ll tell me what they cost you, Sunny, I&#8217;ll
square up now. How&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He pulled out some money, but the loafer waved it aside
with ridiculous dignity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thievin&#8217; doctors needs pay. I ain&#8217;t no bum doc. What
you give &#8217;em&ndash;&ndash;the kids?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio bundled his money back into his pocket, flushing
at the thought that he had unintentionally insulted his benefactor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said thoughtfully, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t give &#8217;em no corn
cure. Y&#8217;see,&#8221; he added apologetically, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t find no
corns on &#8217;em to speak of. But,&#8221; he went on more hopefully,
&#8220;I give &#8217;em the cough cure. They ain&#8217;t got no coughs,
neither of &#8217;em, but, seein&#8217; they was to take a bath, I guessed
it &#8217;ud be a kind of precaution. Then there were them powders.
How were they called? Why&ndash;&ndash;Lick&ndash;&ndash;Lick&ndash;&ndash;well,
they were called Lick&ndash;&ndash;something. Anyways, I give
&#8217;em one each. They didn&#8217;t take &#8217;em easy, an&#8217; was nigh sick,
but they got &#8217;em down after awhile. Then, seein&#8217; they got
bruises on their legs, playin&#8217;, I rubbed &#8217;em good with hoss
lin&#8217;ment. After that I give &#8217;em some o&#8217; that tonic&ndash;&ndash;quinine
an&#8217; something. An&#8217; then, seein&#8217; they couldn&#8217;t eat food this
mornin&#8217;, an&#8217; had got sick headaches, I give &#8217;em one o&#8217; them
fizzy Seidlitz fellers between &#8217;em. Jamie bein&#8217; the smallest
I give him the thin white packet, an&#8217; the other, the blue one,
I give to Vada. That seemed to fix them good, an I guess
they&#8217;re most ready fer their baths by now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guessed you&#8217;d treat &#8217;em right,&#8221; approved Sunny
seriously. &#8220;Ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; like physic. You&#8217;re sure a
wise guy, Zip.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy Joyce agreed, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;You was dead right,&#8221; he said impressively. &#8220;It don&#8217;t
never do takin&#8217; chances with kids o&#8217; that age. Chances is
bum things, anyway. Y&#8217;see, kids ken ketch such a heap o&#8217;
things. Ther&#8217;s bile, an&#8217; measles, an&#8217; dropsy, an&#8217; cancer, an&#8217;
hydryfoby, an&#8217; all kinds o&#8217; things. They&#8217;s li&#8217;ble to ketch &#8217;em
as easy as gettin&#8217; flies wi&#8217; molasses. An&#8217; some o&#8217; them is
ter&#8217;ble bad. Ever had hydryfoby? No? Wal, I ain&#8217;t
neither, but I see a feller with it oncet, an&#8217; he jest went
around barkin&#8217; like a camp dog chasin&#8217; after swill bar&#8217;ls, an&#8217;
was scared to death o&#8217; water&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some folks don&#8217;t need hydryfoby fer that,&#8221; put in Toby,
with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t no call fer you buttin&#8217; in,&#8221; flashed Sandy
angrily. &#8220;Guess I&#8217;m talkin&#8217; o&#8217; things you ain&#8217;t heerd tell
of. You ain&#8217;t out o&#8217; your cradle yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned back to his host and prepared to continue his
list of horrors, but Sunny forestalled him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talkin&#8217; o&#8217; water,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you ain&#8217;t bathed the kids
yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;The water&#8217;s cookin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cookin&#8217;?&#8221; Toby whistled.</p>
<p>Sunny sat up, all interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hot bath?&#8221; he inquired, with wide eyes. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t
givin&#8217; &#8217;em a <i>hot</i> bath?&#8221; he exclaimed incredulously.</p>
<p>A troubled look came into Scipio&#8217;s pale eyes. He doubted
his purpose in face of his friends&#8217; astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes. That&#8217;s how I <i>was</i> thinking,&#8221; he said weakly.
&#8220;Y&#8217;see, I guessed it would soften the dirt quicker, and make
it easy wipin&#8217; it off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But ain&#8217;t you scared o&#8217; them&ndash;&ndash;peelin&#8217;?&#8221; inquired
Sandy, refusing to be left out of the discussion.</p>
<p>Scipio looked perplexed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peelin&#8217;?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t think I get you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; explained Sandy readily, &#8220;peelin&#8217; their skins off
&#8217;em. You allus sets potatoes in b&#8217;ilin&#8217; water to git their
skins peeled quick. Same with hogs. Same with most anything.
I call that a fool chance to take.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio&#8217;s perplexity merged into a mild smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t jest set &#8217;em into boilin&#8217; water,&#8221; he explained;
&#8220;kind of warm, with a bit o&#8217; soda.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny approved.</p>
<p>&#8220;That sure don&#8217;t sound too bad,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;But wot
about &#8217;em gettin&#8217; cold? Takin&#8217; all that dirt off sudden,
y&#8217;see&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dosed &#8217;em wi&#8217; cough cure,&#8221; broke in Toby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; agreed Sunny. &#8220;I&#8217;d fergot&ndash;&ndash;Say&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he
turned to the doorway and craned towards it&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;here&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;here&#8217;s
Wild Bill coming along.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toby promptly scrambled up from the door-sill and made
way for the Trust president. He strode into the room with
a quick glance round and a short, harsh &#8220;Howdy?&#8221; for the
lesser members of his corporation. His manner towards
Scipio was no less unbending.</p>
<p>And, curiously enough, his coming silenced all further
discussion. Scipio had nothing to say whatever, and the
others felt that here was their leader from whom they must
take their cue.</p>
<p>Nor was it long in coming. Scipio rose and offered his
chair to the newcomer, but the gambler promptly kicked the
proffered seat aside, and took up his position on the fuel-box.
He glared into the little man&#8217;s face for a few seconds,
and then opened his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal?&#8221; he drawled.</p>
<p>Scipio stirred uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m real glad to see you, Bill,&#8221; he managed to mumble
out. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t got no rye&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rye&ndash;&ndash;hell!&#8221; The gambler was not a patient man, and
the laws of hospitality interested him not in the least.
&#8220;Say&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he pointed at the open Bible on the table beside
Sandy&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;takin&#8217; on psalm-smitin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio hurled himself into the breach.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s them regulations Sunny give me for raisin&#8217; the kids.
They need a Bible talk after their bath. I bin readin&#8217; up
some.&#8221;</p>
<p>A momentary twinkle flashed into the gambler&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you give &#8217;em their bath?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>Scipio pointed at the stove, on which the water was already
boiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;The water&#8217;s cookin&#8217;,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Guess it&#8217;s most
ready.&#8221; The gambler glanced round the room severely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why the devil is you&#8217;se fellers settin&#8217; around?
Wher&#8217;s the tub?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Down at the creek. It&#8217;s the wash-tub,&#8221; Scipio explained,
bestirring himself. The other men stood up ready.</p>
<p>There was no doubt that Bill had taken possession of the
situation. He always seemed to dominate his fellows.
Now he caught Scipio&#8217;s eye and held him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest gather the things up quick,&#8221; he said authoritatively,
&#8220;an&#8217; we&#8217;ll get busy.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as Scipio heaped up the necessary articles for the
bath on the table, he looked on with the keenest interest.
Finally the little man paused beside the heap, holding in his
hand the box of water-softener, which he was eyeing somewhat
doubtfully. Bill&#8217;s eyes still twinkled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wot&#8217;s that?&#8221; he demanded in his savage way, as though
he had never seen the box before.</p>
<p>&#8220;That? Why, that&#8217;s for bathin&#8217;,&#8221; said Scipio doubtfully.
&#8220;Y&#8217;see, it&#8217;s a fixin&#8217; swell ladies in Noo York an&#8217; such places
use for makin&#8217; their baths soft an&#8217; dandy. Sunny brought it
along last night. He guessed it would be elegant for the
kids. Y&#8217;see, his mother sent it a present to him. He didn&#8217;t
reckon he had use for it, seein&#8217; he took his bath in the creek
every mornin&#8217;. He guessed natural water was best for
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill snorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunny&#8217;s a bright lad,&#8221; he said, while Toby softly exploded
with laughter in the doorway.</p>
<p>But the gambler was bent on the purpose in hand, and
promptly dismissed the loafer&#8217;s fairy-story from his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, get around and bear a hand,&#8221; he cried, indicating
the pile on the table. &#8220;You, Toby, quit laffin&#8217; an&#8217; git a holt
on them clean laundry. An&#8217; say, don&#8217;t you muss &#8217;em any.
Sunny, you best pile up them washin&#8217; fixin&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;that hand-scrubber,
the soap, that wash-flannel an&#8217; the towels. Guess
that&#8217;s the nighest you&#8217;ll ever come to bathin&#8217; yourself.
Sandy Joyce ken carry the hot water, an&#8217;, if Zip&#8217;s yaller pup
gets around, see you don&#8217;t scald him any. Guess I&#8217;ll handle
these yer dippers. That way Zip&#8217;ll be free to take the kids
along. After they&#8217;re bathed they ken set around in the
sun, while Zip gives &#8217;em a real elegant Bible talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole thing was simplicity itself in the capable hands
of a man of Bill&#8217;s energy. But for his advent the bath
might have been delayed until the water on the cookstove
had boiled away. What with Sandy&#8217;s love of debate and
Sunny&#8217;s indolence, the visit of these men might have been
prolonged for hours. As it was, in five minutes after Bill&#8217;s
appearance upon the scene the cort&eacute;ge was ready to set out
for the water&#8217;s edge; and not only ready, but more than
willing to submit the all-unconscious twins to the combination
of their inexperienced efforts in matters ablutionary.
The one saving clause for the poor little creatures was the
presence of their father and a man of practical intelligence
such as the gambler. How they might have fared at the
hands of the others is a matter best not contemplated too
closely.</p>
<p>At a word from Wild Bill the procession set out. Scipio
headed it, with a child clinging to each hand, doddling along
at his side all blissfully unconscious, but delighted at going
whither their elders led them. Vada babbled with delight,
and kept up a fire of chattering questions in a truly feminine
manner, while little Jamie, stolid but no less joyous, devoured
everything with hungry, thoughtful eyes, and punctuated
his sister&#8217;s remarks with characteristic grunts, and an
occasional emphatic ejaculation and protest at the yellow
pup, who would lick his dirty legs.</p>
<p>Behind these came Sandy Joyce, the picture of absurd
dignity, as he vainly strove to carry the boiler of water without
scalding himself. Toby came immediately behind him,
with the bundle of laundry, a tumbled mass in his arms,
crushed firmly to his stout chest, lest, by any ill-fate, he
should drop any of the strange garments, which looked so
absurdly small in his ignorant eyes.</p>
<p>Next came Sunny with the cleansing properties, which he
carried gingerly, as though the very nature of them were
repugnant to him, and the labor of carrying them an offense
to his creed of life. The soap particularly troubled him.
Its slippery nature made him drop it several times, till it
seemed almost as though it resented him personally, and was
trying to escape from the insult of such association. Wild
Bill brought up the rear of the column, bearing the bright
tin dippers, which clattered violently as they swung together
on their string loops. He suggested nothing so much as a
herder driving before him his unusual flock by the aid of a
violent rattling on tin cans.</p>
<p>Solemnly the procession wound its way down the hill.
Only the voices of the children, the yapping of the pup and
the clatter of tinware enlivened the journey. The men&#8217;s
minds were engrossed with their various charges. It was
serious&ndash;&ndash;desperately serious. But then, a bath in any
form, much less a bath of two small children, was an affair
of the gravest importance to these men. Then, too, there
was nervousness with it. Everybody felt responsible, from
the father to the desperate instigator of what was, in their
minds, something almost amounting to an outrage.</p>
<p>However, the windings and roughnesses of the path, as it
twisted its way through the scrubby bushes lining the creek
bank, were finally negotiated more or less satisfactorily.
The mishaps were not as great as might have been anticipated.
Sandy only scalded himself twice, and his curses
had to be stifled by a sharp reprimand from the gambler.
Toby skidded down the slope once, and only saved the
laundry at the personal expense of a torn shirt and a grazed
elbow. Sunny, except for his difference of opinion with the
soap, enjoyed no other mishap, and Bill&#8217;s only transgression
was to send one of the dippers, amidst a volley of curses,
hurtling at the yellow pup, who at one time threatened to upset
all Sandy&#8217;s dignity, and incidentally the boiling water, by
getting mixed up with that worthy widower&#8217;s legs.</p>
<p>The halt was made beside the wash-tub, and childish
curiosity promptly asserted itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t washin&#8217; more clothes, poppa?&#8221; demanded
Vada, with wide questioning eyes. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t this Sunday?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pop-pa wash tothes,&#8221; mumbled Jamie.</p>
<p>Sunny took it upon himself to put the matter right in the
small minds. He beamed upon the children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poppa&#8217;s going to wash <i>you</i>,&#8221; he said, with unction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wot for?&#8221; demanded Vada. &#8220;We ain&#8217;t done nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cos you needs it,&#8221; replied the loafer, uncomfortably
avoiding the blandly questioning eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; interjected Jamie.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ain&#8217;t as dirty as you,&#8221; said Vada, after a thoughtful
pause.</p>
<p>Sunny busied himself laying out the utensils on the grassiest
spot he could find. Toby glanced round after depositing
the laundry department. He guffawed loudly, and went on
with his work. Sunny&#8217;s face went a dirty scarlet, but he refrained
from retort. And promptly little Vada went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want bath,&#8221; she protested plaintively. And
Jamie chorused in with a grunt of agreement, while he
busied himself trying to climb up the sides of the tub.</p>
<p>Scipio snatched him away, and looked round weakly for
support. It came in a sharp command from Bill, who had
seated himself on a fallen tree-trunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git busy,&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;Set that doggone water in the
tub, an&#8217; Sunny ken dip the boiler full of cold. You boys
ken do that while Zip gets the kids ready. Guess he&#8217;ll likely
know best wher&#8217; the strings an&#8217; buttons is.&#8221;</p>
<p>His orders were silently executed by the men. But the
children had no awe of the gambler, and their protests were
many and querulous. However, the tub was filled satisfactorily,
and Scipio finally succeeded in fumbling the clothes
off the children.</p>
<p>It was a curious scene. Scipio moved about with an air
of the mildest perplexity. Sunny slouched through his
work as though it were the hardest of labor, although he was
really enjoying himself. Toby was grinning all over his
face with huge enjoyment, while Sandy performed his share
with such an aspect of care that his labors might have been
of an absolutely epoch-making nature. Bill suggested
simple authority. The &#8220;kids&#8221; must be bathed, and he was
going to see it done.</p>
<p>When all preparations had been made, Scipio became the
chief operator, and each man took up his position where best
he could witness the process. There was something so
mildly stimulating to these ruffians in observing the clumsy
lavering of two small children. They all appreciated cleanliness
in theory; it was only the practice that they were unaccustomed
to, and here it was being demonstrated before
their interested eyes. They watched Scipio&#8217;s efforts for
some moments in silence, while he, with gentle persuasion,
overcame each childish protest. He did it in such a kindly,
patient way that very soon these small atoms of humanity,
sitting facing each other cross-legged in the tub, gained
ample confidence, and gave expression to infantile delight by
splashing each other with water, and incidentally treating
their father to an even less welcome bath.</p>
<p>They laughed and crowed and chattered while their father
plied the house-flannel, and only were their piping voices
quiet at such moments as their small round faces were
smothered with soapsuds, or lost in the embracing folds of
the none too savory cloth.</p>
<p>But on the part of the spectators, their interest would not
permit of long silence. And it was Sandy Joyce, quite irrepressible
where advice was concerned, who found it necessary
to interfere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you rubbin&#8217; &#8217;em too hard?&#8221; he questioned, after
prolonged cogitation.</p>
<p>Scipio turned to reply in the midst of swabbing Jamie&#8217;s
lower limbs. He was holding one foot dangerously high in
the air, and the movement caused him to upset the child&#8217;s
balance, so that his upper part promptly disappeared beneath
the frothing suds. A wild splashing and yell from Vada
warned her father of the threatened tragedy, and Jamie was
hauled up, coughing and spluttering. The little man, with
scared face, sought at once to pacify the frightened child,
while Sunny withered the interfering widower with a few
well-chosen words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you&#8217;d butt in an&#8217; tell folk they wasn&#8217;t nailin&#8217; up your
coffin right,&#8221; he cried angrily. &#8220;Will you kep that instrument
o&#8217; foolishness o&#8217; yours quiet fer ten minutes?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy flushed.</p>
<p>&#8220;They ain&#8217;t got hides like hogs,&#8221; he grumbled. &#8220;They
needs handlin&#8217; easy. Say, jest look what he&#8217;s doin&#8217; now.
What&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off, and all eyes watched Scipio&#8217;s movements as
he turned Jamie over, and, supporting his dripping body
in the crook of his arm, plied the flannel upon the boy&#8217;s
back. The moment was a tense one. Then a sigh of relief
went up as the child dropped back in the water with a
splash.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t never see kids handled that way,&#8221; cried the disgusted
Sandy, unable to keep silence any longer. Then, as
no one seemed inclined to question his statement, he went
on, &#8220;Wot I sez is, kids needs women-folk to do they things
right. Zip&#8217;s handlin&#8217; &#8217;em like raw beef.&#8221; Then he turned
on Sunny, whose rebuke was still rankling. &#8220;Guess you&#8217;ll
say he ain&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;bein&#8217; contrary. Now, ef I was washin&#8217; &#8217;em,
I&#8217;d&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up,&#8221; cried Wild Bill harshly. Then he added,
with biting sarcasm, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t surprised you&#8217;re a widder-man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toby made no attempt to disguise his laughter, and it
maddened the unfortunate Sandy; and if a look could have
killed, Sunny would have died grinning. However, the
widower sheltered himself in the silence demanded of him
until the children were lifted out of the tub and dried by
their patient father. Nor did he even attempt to further
interfere while their parent struggled them into their little
woolen undershirts.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXIV_A_BIBLE_TALK' id='CHAPTER_XXIV_A_BIBLE_TALK'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>&ndash;&ndash;A BIBLE TALK</h3>
</div>
<p>It was with a sigh of relief that Scipio now turned to
Wild Bill. Somehow, he naturally looked to him for
guidance. Nor did he quite know why.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout that Bible talk?&#8221; he inquired. &#8220;Guess you said
they best set around in the sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure did. Guess they kind o&#8217; need airin&#8217; some.
&#8217;Tain&#8217;t no use in settin&#8217; in their clothes damp; they&#8217;ll be
gettin&#8217; sick, sure. Ther&#8217;s a dandy bit o&#8217; grass right here.
Best set &#8217;em down, an&#8217; get around an&#8217; hand &#8217;em your talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the worried father pushed his weedy hair off his
forehead with a troubled air.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t read up a deal,&#8221; he apologized.</p>
<p>The gambler promptly swept his objection aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;That don&#8217;t figger any. Once you get goin&#8217; you won&#8217;t
find no trouble. It&#8217;s dead easy after you&#8217;re started. That&#8217;s
the way it is with passons. They jest get a holt of a notion,
an&#8217; then&ndash;&ndash;why, they jest yarn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; replied Scipio doubtfully, while the other men
gathered round. &#8220;But,&#8221; he went on more weakly still,
&#8220;&#8217;bout that notion?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill stirred impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. You start right in with the notion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Course,&#8221; cried Sandy. &#8220;The notion&#8217;s easy. Why,
ther&#8217;s heaps o&#8217; things you ken take as a notion. Say, wa&#8217;an&#8217;t
ther&#8217; a yarn &#8217;bout some blamed citizen what took to a cave,
an&#8217; the checkens an&#8217; things got busy feedin&#8217; him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ravens,&#8221; said Sunny.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ravens nuthin&#8217;,&#8221; cried the indignant Sandy.
&#8220;Checkens of the air, they was.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunny shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t no sort o&#8217; Bible talk, anyway,&#8221; he protested.
&#8220;You need suthin&#8217; what gives &#8217;em a lesson. Now, ther&#8217;s
Nore an&#8217; his floatin&#8217; ranch&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That wa&#8217;an&#8217;t a ranch neither,&#8221; contradicted Sandy
promptly. &#8220;It was jest a barn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ark,&#8221; said Toby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, ark then,&#8221; admitted Sandy. He didn&#8217;t mind
Toby&#8217;s interference.</p>
<p>But the discussion was allowed to go no further. Bill&#8217;s
impatience manifested itself promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, it don&#8217;t matter a cuss whether it was an ark or a
barn or a ranch. Sunny&#8217;s yarn goes. Now, jest set around
an&#8217; git the kids in the middle, an&#8217; you, Zip, git busy with
this Nore racket.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last authority had given its decision. There was no
more to be said, and the matter was promptly proceeded
with. The expectant children, who had stood by listening
to the discussion of their elders, were now seated on the
grass, and before them sat the board of Scriptural instruction.
Bill remained in his position on the tree-trunk. On
the ground, cross-legged, sat Scipio, on his right. Sunny
lounged full length upon the ground next to him. Sandy
and Toby formed the other horn of the half-circle on the
gambler&#8217;s left.</p>
<p>It was a quaint picture upon which the warm noon sun
shone down. The open grass clearing, surrounded with
tall dense bushes. On one side the wash-tub and the various
appurtenances of the bath, with the creek a little way
beyond. And in the open, sitting alone, side by side, their
little pink bodies bare of all but their coarse woolen undershirts,
their little faces shining with wholesome soap, their
eyes bright with expectancy for the story that was to come,
the two pretty children of a lonely father. Then, in a
semicircle about them, the members of the Trust, with their
hard, unclean faces, their rough clothes and rougher manners,
and their uncultured minds driven by hearts that were&ndash;&ndash;well,
just human.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git busy,&#8221; ordered Bill, when the Trust had finally
settled itself.</p>
<p>And promptly Scipio, with more determination than discretion,
cleared his throat and plunged into his peroration.</p>
<p>His mild face beamed. Gentleness and affection shone in
every line of it. And somehow his diffidence, the realization
of his ignorance of the work demanded of him, were
absorbed and lost to his consciousness in the wonderful
parental delight of teaching his offspring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, kiddies,&#8221; he began, with that soft inflection that
seems so much a part of some men of rough manners, &#8220;I
want you to listen careful to a yarn I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to tell you
about. Y&#8217;see&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He hesitated, and unconsciously one hand was lifted and
passed across his brow with a movement that suggested
puzzlement. It was as though he were not quite sure
whither his story were going to lead him.</p>
<p>The gambler nodded encouragingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully,&#8221; he murmured, turning his eyes just for one
moment in the little man&#8217;s direction. But it was only for
a moment. The next he was staring absorbedly out at the
bush opposite, like a man lost in some train of thought far
removed from the matter in hand. His beady eyes stared
unsmilingly, but with curious intentness.</p>
<p>However, Scipio was far too much concerned with what
lay before him to think of anything else. But the sharply
spoken encouragement spurred him, and he went ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, maybe you both heard tell how God made this
funny old world for us to live in,&#8221; he went on, endeavoring
to give lightness to his manner. &#8220;He made Sufferin&#8217;
Creek, too&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Toby coughed, and Sandy whispered audibly to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t guess Zip ought to run Sufferin&#8217; Creek in this
yarn,&#8221; he said seriously. &#8220;Sufferin&#8217; Creek don&#8217;t seem
right in a Bible talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio waited, and then, ignoring the comment, labored
clumsily on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to tell you a yarn about it. Y&#8217;see,
kiddies&ndash;&ndash;y&#8217;see, ther&#8217; weren&#8217;t a heap o&#8217; folk around when
God first fixed things right&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest one man an&#8217; a snake,&#8221; interrupted Sandy in his
informative way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up,&#8221; whispered Toby, prodding him with his elbow.
Sandy scowled, but remained silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; continued Scipio, &#8220;as I was sayin&#8217;, He jest made
one sort o&#8217; sample man an&#8217; a snake. An&#8217;,&#8221; he added, suddenly
brightening under inspiration, &#8220;He sot &#8217;em in a
garden, an&#8217; called it the Garden of Eden.&#8221;</p>
<p>Little Vada suddenly clapped her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, an&#8217; it was all flowers an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; fruit,&#8221; she cried
ecstatically.</p>
<p>Jamie&#8217;s eyes were dancing with delight, too, but he remained
silent, waiting for developments.</p>
<p>The members of the Trust looked on with the deepest
interest. Each man&#8217;s face wore a half-smile&ndash;&ndash;that is, all
except the gambler&#8217;s, who still appeared to be absorbed in
his own thought&ndash;&ndash;and the bush opposite. But the interest
of these men was less in the little man&#8217;s story than in a
speculation as to when he was going to break down, and
yield his tutelary attitude before a battery of infantile questions.</p>
<p>However, Scipio was still in a fairly strong position.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he agreed, &#8220;I do guess ther&#8217; was fruit ther&#8217;, but
I don&#8217;t guess it was a fruit ranch exactly. Maybe it was
sort of mixed farmin&#8217;. Howsum, that don&#8217;t matter a heap.
Y&#8217;see, ther&#8217; was heaps an&#8217; heaps of animals, an&#8217; bugs, an&#8217;
spiders, an&#8217; things&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; jest one man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217; was a woman,&#8221; corrected the irrepressible Sandy.
&#8220;That&#8217;s dead sure. They got busy on one of the man&#8217;s
ribs an&#8217; made her. Ain&#8217;t that so, Toby?&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to the squat figure beside him for corroboration,
but Sunny took up the matter from across the semicircle.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a wise guy,&#8221; he exclaimed scornfully. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
you kep from buttin&#8217; in? Say, I&#8217;d hate to know sech a heap
as you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just for an instant Wild Bill turned his sharp eyes on his
companions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up you&#8217;se all,&#8221; he cried. And promptly Scipio
was allowed to continue his story.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, &#8217;bout that garden,&#8221; he said thoughtfully. &#8220;Y&#8217;see,
God told that feller he wasn&#8217;t to pick no fruit. Y&#8217;see, I
guess it was needed fer cannin&#8217; or preservin&#8217;. Maybe it
was needed for makin&#8217; elegant candy. I don&#8217;t know
rightly&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re talkin&#8217; foolish,&#8221; exclaimed Sandy, jumping up
excitedly. &#8220;Cannin&#8217;?&#8221; he cried scornfully. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t
can fruit them days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Scipio apologetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I am,&#8221; snorted Sandy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then shut up,&#8221; cried Bill, without turning his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; went on Scipio, when all argument had
ceased, &#8220;it was jest up to that feller not to pick that fruit.
An&#8217; he didn&#8217;t mean to neither, only he got kind o&#8217; friendly
with that snake&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Little Vada jumped up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know&ndash;&ndash;I know,&#8221; she cried, in the wildest excitement.
&#8220;The snake made him eat an apple, an&#8217; then the rain came
down, an&#8217; poured an&#8217; poured&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poured an&#8217; poured,&#8221; echoed Jamie, jumping to his feet
and dancing around his sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; admitted Scipio, in relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poured nothin&#8217;,&#8221; murmured Sandy under his breath.
&#8220;He&#8217;s messin&#8217; up the whole yarn.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as his comment didn&#8217;t reach the father&#8217;s ears he went
on placidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, the rain poured down,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so they was nigh
drownded&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&#8217;d the rain tum?&#8221; suddenly inquired Jamie with
interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; murmured Scipio. Then he added brightly,
&#8220;Because he picked the fruit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y&#8217;see,&#8221; explained Vada, with sisterly patronage, &#8220;he
didn&#8217;t orter picked the apple.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jamie nodded without understanding.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; went on Scipio, taking advantage of the pause,
&#8220;he was nigh drownded, an&#8217; he had to swim an&#8217; swim, an&#8217;
then he built himself a ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Barn,&#8221; cried Sandy, unable to keep quiet any longer.
&#8220;It was a barn to kep his stock in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ark,&#8221; said Toby decidedly. &#8220;He built a Nore&#8217;s Ark&ndash;&ndash;same
as toys kiddies plays with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Bill said Sunny&#8217;s yarn goes,&#8221; protested the troubled
Scipio. And, receiving an affirmatory nod from the preoccupied
gambler, he went on. &#8220;Wal, he set that ranch
afloat, an&#8217; put out a boat an&#8217; rescued all the other animals,
an&#8217; bugs, an&#8217; spiders, an&#8217; things, an&#8217; then set out a duck to
see how things was going&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a duck, Zip,&#8221; said Sunny, shaking his head sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Course not,&#8221; agreed Sandy scornfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pigeon,&#8221; suggested Toby.</p>
<p>But little Vada saved the situation. She jumped to her
feet, dragging Jamie with her. Her dark eyes were shining,
and her round little cheeks were scarlet with excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a duck, nor a pigeon, nor nothin&#8217; but a parrot,&#8221;
she declared. &#8220;Momma told us. He sent out a parrot; an&#8217;
it flew, an&#8217; flew, an&#8217; flew. An&#8217; then it come back to the
ark, carryin&#8217; a tree in its beak. An&#8217; then Nore knew there
wasn&#8217;t no more rain, nor nothing, an&#8217; they turned his wife
into a pillow o&#8217; salt &#8217;cos she&#8217;d made him eat the apple. An&#8217;,
pop-pa, tell us another.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ess, a nudder,&#8221; cried Jamie, his chubby fat legs
wabbling under him as he danced about&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;a nudder&ndash;&ndash;a
nudder&ndash;&ndash;a nud&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But his lisping request was never completed, for, without
a word of warning, Wild Bill suddenly leapt from his seat,
and, with a wave of his arm, swept the two children sprawling
into their father&#8217;s lap, while he charged across the
clearing. Just for a fraction of a second he paused as he
closed on the bush he had so long contemplated, and his
friends heard his voice in a furious oath.</p>
<p>&#8220;You son of a&ndash;&ndash;!&#8221; he roared; and simultaneously there
was a flash and a sharp report from his gun&ndash;&ndash;another, and
yet another. Then he vanished into the bush, his smoking
revolver still in his hand ready for use, followed, with no
less speed, by Toby and Sandy Joyce.</p>
<p>For a moment Scipio stared; but Sunny Oak seemed to
grasp something of the situation. He flung himself before
the two children, his right hand gripping a revolver which
he always carried concealed amongst his rags. And at the
same moment the gambler&#8217;s voice came back to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huyk them kids right back to the store, an&#8217; kep &#8217;em
there!&#8221; it cried. And instantly the indolent loafer, with a
movement almost electrical in its swiftness, seized Vada in
his arms and dashed off up the hill, followed by the little
father, bearing the screaming Jamie in his.</p>
<p>Inside the bush the three men searched, with eyes and
ears alert in the fashion of furious terriers. The branches
and inner leaves were spattered with blood, showing that
the gambler&#8217;s shots had taken some effect. The ground,
too, was covered with footprints.</p>
<p>With a rush Bill set off trailing the latter, and so soft was
the ground that he had little or no difficulty in the matter.
The trail took them along the creek bank, and here and
there a splash of blood warned them that their quarry was
severely wounded.</p>
<p>But, even so, they were doomed to disappointment.
Thirty yards from the clearing they came to a spot where
the moist soil was well beaten with horse&#8217;s hoofs, and here
the human footprints ended. All three men stared out
down the creek. And then it was that another furious oath
escaped the gambler&#8217;s lips, as he beheld a racing horseman
making good his escape, more than a hundred yards below
them.</p>
<p>For some moments Wild Bill stood raging impotently.
Then he turned on his companions, with a perfect devil
glaring out of his ferocious eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;God&#8217;s curse light on &#8217;em!&#8221; he roared. &#8220;It&#8217;s James&#8217;
gang. May his soul rot. I&#8217;ll get &#8217;em! I&#8217;ll get &#8217;em!
They&#8217;re after those kids. But, by the wall-eyed Mackinaw,
they shan&#8217;t touch a hair o&#8217; their heads as long as I&#8217;m a livin&#8217;
man. It&#8217;s war, boys! D&#8217;ye hear? It&#8217;s him an&#8217; me. Me&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;
James! An&#8217; I swar to God he&#8217;ll go down an&#8217; out as
sure as my name&#8217;s Wild Bill!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>WILD BILL FIRES A BOMB</h3>
</div>
<p>When Wild Bill returned to his hut later on in the afternoon
he was consumed by a cold, hard rage, such as comes
but rarely in the life of any man. There was no demonstrativeness:
he had no words to give it expression. It was
the rage of a man who coldly, calmly collects every faculty
of brain and body into one great concentration for harm to
its object. It was a moment when every evil thought and
feeling was drawn into a cruel longing for harm&ndash;&ndash;harm
calculated to be of the most merciless description.</p>
<p>Neither of the companions who had joined him in the
pursuit of the man they had discovered lurking down at the
river had any real understanding of what lay in the back of
the gambler&#8217;s mind. His outburst there had been the first
volcanic rage which had lit the fires of hate now burning
so deep down in his intolerant heart. That outburst they
had understood. That was the man as they knew him.
But this other man they knew nothing of. This was the
real man who returned to his hut, silent and ghastly, with
implacable hatred burning in his heart.</p>
<p>All three had hurriedly and silently returned to the store
from their futile chase. Bill offered no explanation, and his
manner was so forbidding that even the intrepid Sandy had
found no use for the questions he would so gladly have
put.</p>
<p>When they arrived, Scipio and Sunny, with the twins, had
reached the place just before them. But they were lost
sight of in the rush that was made to tell the gambler of the
happenings at Sid Morton&#8217;s ranch. Nor had he any choice
but to listen to the luridly narrated facts. However, his
choice did fall in with their desires, and, after the first
brief outline, told with all the imagination this varied collection
of beings was capable of, he found himself demanding,
as eagerly as they were waiting to tell, every detail of the
matter, and even went so far as to examine the body of the
dead rancher, roughly laid out in the barn on a bed of hay.
He listened almost without comment, which was unusual in
him. His manner displayed no heat. He was cold, critical,
and his only words were to ask sharp and definitely pointed
questions. Then, having given Minky instructions for the
safeguarding of the children, he departed without even mentioning
his own adventure down at the river.</p>
<p>But if he neglected to do so, it was otherwise with his
friends, the other members of the Trust. The moment his
back was turned they shed the story broadcast, each man
competing with the other in his endeavor to make it thoroughly
palatable to the sensation-loving ears of their fellow-townsmen.
And probably of them all Sandy was the most
successful.</p>
<p>In half-an-hour, loyally supported by his friends, he had
the whole of Suffering Creek strung to such a pitch of nervous
excitement that every man was set looking to his firearms,
and all talk was directed towards the most adequate
means of defending their homes and property.</p>
<p>In the briefest possible time, from a peaceful, industrious
camp, Suffering Creek was transformed into a war base,
every citizen stirred not only to defense of his own, but
with a longing to march out to the fray, to seek these land
pirates in the open and to exterminate them, as they would
willingly exterminate any other vermin.</p>
<p>Men talked war. Brains were feverishly racked for
strategy, and for historical accounts of a similar situation in
which a town rose to arms and took the law into its own
hands. Stories flew from lip to lip, and, as is usual under
such stress, so did the convivial glass.</p>
<p>And the result which followed was quite in keeping with
the occasion. Quarrels and bickerings occurred, which kept
the place at fever-heat until the store closed down for the
night and the supply of liquor was cut off. Then slumber
brought its beneficent opiate to distracted nerves.</p>
<p>Throughout it all Minky kept his head level. Whatever
he felt and thought, he had nothing to offer on the altar of
public suggestion. He knew that of all these irresponsible
debaters he had the most to lose. Nor did he feel inclined
to expose anything of the risk at which he stood. It was a
depressing time for him, so depressing that he could see very
little hope. His risk was enormous. He felt that the probability
was that this raiding gang were well enough posted
as to the store of gold he held in his cellars. He felt that,
should James or any of his people decide upon a coup, the
attack would be well timed, when the miners were out at
their work, and he and the camp generally were left defenseless.</p>
<p>What could he do? He must rid himself of the &#8220;dust&#8221;
somehow. He must dispose of it secretly. A hiding&ndash;&ndash;that
seemed to him, amidst his trouble, to be the only thing.
But where? That was the thing. He must consult Bill.
To his mind Bill was the only man upon whom he could
place any real reliance, upon whose judgment he could depend.
So, with his shrewd eyes ever on the watch for
strangers amongst his customers, he longed for the hours to
pass until he could close his store and seek the gambler in
his hut.</p>
<p>In the meantime Wild Bill had cut himself off from his
fellows, spending the long evening hours in the solitude of
his humble dwelling. The man was strangely calm, but his
fierce eyes and pale face told of an enormous strain of
thought driving him. His mind was sweeping along over a
series of vivid pictures of past events, mixed up with equally
vivid and strongly marked scenes of possible events to come.
He was reviewing silently, sternly, a situation which, by
some extraordinary kink in his vanity, he felt it was for him
to assume the responsibility of. He felt, although with no
feeling of pride, that he, and he alone, could see it
through.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter was that, by some strange mental
process, James&#8217; doings&ndash;&ndash;his approach to the camp, in fact
his very existence&ndash;&ndash;had somehow become a direct individual
challenge to him. Without acknowledging it to
himself, he in some subtle way understood that everything
this desperado did was a challenge to him&ndash;&ndash;a sneering,
contemptuous challenge to him. James was metaphorically
snapping his fingers under his very nose.</p>
<p>That these were his feelings was undeniable. That the
thoughts of the possibilities of an attack on the camp were
the mainspring of his antagonism to the man, that this voluntary
guardianship of Scipio and his twins was the source of
his rage against him, it was impossible to believe. They
may have influenced him in a small degree, but only in a
small degree. The man was cast in a very different mold
from that of a simple philanthropist. It was the man&#8217;s
vanity, the headstrong vanity of a strong and selfish man,
that drove him. And as he sat silently raging under his
thoughts of the happenings of that day, had he put his paramount
feelings into words he would have demanded how
James dared to exist in a district which he, Wild Bill of
Abilene, had made his own.</p>
<p>He spent the evening sitting on his bed or pacing his little
hut, his thoughts tumbling headlong through his brain. He
found himself almost absently inspecting his armory, and
loading and unloading his favorite weapons. There was no
definite direction in anything he thought or did, unless it
were in the overwhelming hatred against James which
colored his every feeling. Without realizing it, every force
of mind and body was seeking inspiration.</p>
<p>And the evening was well-nigh spent before inspiration
came. Careless of time, of everything but his feelings, he
had finally flung himself full length upon his bed, brain-weary
and resourceless. Then came the change. As his
head touched the pillow it almost seemed to rebound; and
he found himself sitting up again glaring at the opposite
wall with the desired inspiration in his gimlet eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; he breathed, with a force that sent the exclamation
hissing through the room.</p>
<p>And for an hour his attitude remained unchanged. His
legs were drawn up and his long arms were clasped about
his knees. His eyes were fiercely focused upon a cartridge-belt
hanging upon the wall, and there they remained, seemingly
a fixture, while thought, no longer chaotic, flew
through his revivified brain. He gave no sign; he uttered
no word. But his face told its story of a fiendish joy which
swept from his head to his heart, and thrilled his whole body.</p>
<p>It was in the midst of this that he received a visit from
his friend Minky. And the moment the door opened in
response to his summons the look in his eyes, when he saw
who his visitor was, was a cordial welcome. He swung
round and dropped his legs over the side of his bunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the time?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>Minky pointed to the alarm-clock on the gambler&#8217;s table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nigh one o&#8217;clock,&#8221; he said, with a faint smile.</p>
<p>But Bill ignored the quiet sarcasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; he cried. Then he brought his eyes to the
other&#8217;s face. They were literally blazing with suppressed
excitement. There was something in them, too, that lifted
Minky out of his desperate mood. Somehow they suggested
hope to him. Somehow the very presence of this
man had a heartening effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; cried the gambler in a tone that thrilled with
power, &#8220;this is Sunday. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,&#8221;
he counted the days off on his lean, muscular fingers.
&#8220;That&#8217;s it, sure. Wednesday we send out a &#8216;stage,&#8217; an&#8217;
you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to ship your gold-dust on it. You&#8217;ll ship it
to Spawn City. Meanwhiles you&#8217;ll buy up all you feel like.
Clean the camp out of &#8216;dust,&#8217; an&#8217; ship it by that stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The storekeeper stared. For a moment he thought his
friend had taken leave of his senses. A scathing refusal
hovered on his lips. But the words never matured. He
was looking into the man&#8217;s burning eyes, and he realized
that a big purpose lay behind his words.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217;,&#8221; he inquired, with a smile from which he could
not quite shut out the irony, &#8220;an&#8217; who&#8217;s goin&#8217; to&ndash;&ndash;drive it
through?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>The storekeeper jumped and his eyes widened. He
started forward. Then he checked himself. He struggled
with a sudden emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; he cried in a sharp whisper. &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t get
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gambler leapt to his feet. He strode down the length
of the hut and came back again. He finally paused before
his bewildered friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, o&#8217; course you don&#8217;t,&#8221; he cried hotly; &#8220;course you
don&#8217;t. Here, how much &#8216;dust&#8217; ken you ship?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;d need to ship sixty thousand dollars&#8217; worth.
That is, if we rake around among the boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minky watched his man closely as he spoke. He was
still doubting, but he was ready enough to be convinced.
He knew it was no use asking too many questions. Wild
Bill hated questions. He watched the latter plunge a
hand into the inside pocket of his coat and draw out a book.
He had no difficulty in recognizing it as the gambler flung it
on the table with a force that set the lamp rattling.</p>
<p>&#8220;There it is,&#8221; he cried, with a fierce oath. &#8220;Ther&#8217;s my
bank-book. Ther&#8217;s seventy odd thousand dollars lyin&#8217; in
the Spawn City bank to my dogasted credit. See?&#8221; He
glared; then he drew a step nearer and bent forward. &#8220;I&#8217;m
handin&#8217; you a check fer your dust,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
seventy thousand dollars says I&#8217;m a better man than James
an&#8217; all his rotten scum, an&#8217; that I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to shoot him to
hell before the week&#8217;s out. <i>Now</i> d&#8217;ye get me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Minky gasped. He had always believed he had long
since fathomed the depths of his wild friend. He had always
believed that the gambler had no moods which were
not well known to him. He had seen him under almost
every condition of stress. Yet here was a side to his character
he had never even dreamed of, and he was flabbergasted.</p>
<p>For a moment he had no words with which to adequately
reply, and he merely shook his head. Instantly the other
flew into one of his savage paroxysms by which it was so
much his habit to carry through his purpose when obstructed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You stand there shakin&#8217; your fool head like some mosey
old cow,&#8221; he cried, with a ruddy flush suddenly mounting
to his temples. &#8220;An&#8217; you&#8217;ll go on shakin&#8217; it till ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t
&#8216;dust&#8217; enuff in your store to bury a louse. You&#8217;ll go on
shakin&#8217; it till James&#8217; gun rips out your vitals. Gee!&#8221; He
threw his arms above his head appealing. &#8220;Give me a
man,&#8221; he cried. Then he brought one fist crashing down
upon the table and shouted his final words: &#8220;Say, you&#8217;ll
get right out an&#8217; post the notices. I&#8217;m buyin&#8217; your &#8216;dust,&#8217;
an&#8217; I&#8217;m driving the stage.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>WILD BILL INSPECTS HIS CLAIM</h3>
</div>
<p>Suffering Creek awoke on the Monday morning laboring
under a hideous depression of nightmare. There was
no buoyancy in the contemplation of the day&#8217;s &#8220;prospect.&#8221;
It was as though that wholesome joy of life which belongs
to the &#8220;outdoor&#8221; man had suddenly been snatched away,
and only the contemplation of a dull round of unprofitable
labor had been left for the burdened mind to dwell upon.</p>
<p>It was in this spirit that Joe Brand rubbed his eyes and
pulled on his moleskin trousers. It was in this spirit that
the miner, White, slouching along to the store for breakfast,
saw and greeted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nuthin&#8217; doin&#8217; in the night,&#8221; he said, in something like
the tone of a disappointed pessimist.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Joe Brand did not feel a great deal like talking.
Besides the nightmare depression that held him he had
drunk a good deal of rye whisky overnight.</p>
<p>White stared out across the creek, whither his thoughts
were still wandering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we&ndash;&ndash;was scairt some,&#8221; he observed, with a
hollow laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe&#8217;s manner was discouraging.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gettin&#8217; breakfast?&#8221; the other inquired presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess so.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the rest of the journey to the store was made in
morose silence.</p>
<p>Others were already astir when they reached their destination.
And at some distance they beheld a small group of
men clustering at one point on the veranda. But such was
their mood that the matter had no interest whatever for
them until they came within hailing distance. Then it was
that they were both startled into new life. Then it was
that all depression was swept away and active interest leapt.
Then it was that sore heads and troubled thoughts gave way
before an excitement almost equal to the previous day&#8217;s,
only that it carried with it a hope which the latter had almost
killed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, don&#8217;t it beat hell?&#8221; demanded a burly prospector
as they came up, pointing back at the wall of the store where
the group was clustering like a swarm of bees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t what?&#8221; inquired Brand, with only partial interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that,&#8221; cried the man, still pointing. &#8220;Ther&#8217; it is,
all writ up ther&#8217;. It&#8217;s in Minky&#8217;s writin&#8217;, too. They&#8217;re
sendin&#8217; out a stage, Wednesday. Git a peek at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Brand and his companion did not wait for his final
suggestion. They, too, had already joined the cluster, and
stood craning on the outskirts of it. Yes, there it was, well
chalked out in Minky&#8217;s bold capitals&ndash;&ndash;an invitation to all
his customers to trade all the gold they chose to part with
to him at the usual rates, or to ship direct to the bank at
Spawn City by a stage that was to leave Suffering Creek at
eight o&#8217;clock on Wednesday morning, its safe delivery insured,
at special rates, by the storekeeper himself.</p>
<p>It was the most astounding notice, under the circumstances,
ever seen on Suffering Creek, and as the citizens
read it excitement surged to a tremendous pitch.</p>
<p>The man called Van expressed something of the thought
in every mind as he turned to Brand, who happened to be
at his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; he cried, with ironical levity. &#8220;Old Minky&#8217;s
plum &#8216;bug.&#8217; He&#8217;s waited to &#8216;unload&#8217; till James&#8217; gang has
got the camp held up three miles out. Wal, I ain&#8217;t shippin&#8217;.
Guess I&#8217;ll trade my dust at a discount. It&#8217;s a sight easier
carryin&#8217; United States currency.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s guaranteein&#8217; delivery at the bank,&#8221; protested
Brand.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what it sez, sure,&#8221; observed White doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;It beats me,&#8221; said the burly miner perplexedly, again
drawn to the notice by the apparent recklessness of its purport.
&#8220;It beats me sure,&#8221; he reiterated. Then, after a
thoughtful pause, he went back to his original statement as
something that expressed the limit of his understanding.
&#8220;It sure do beat hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it was throughout the morning. And by noon every
soul in the camp had seen or heard of Minky&#8217;s contemplated
recklessness. The place was wild with excitement, and,
instead of setting out for their various claims for the usual
day&#8217;s work, every man went out to scrape together any
&#8220;dust&#8221; he possessed, and brought it in to trade.</p>
<p>And Minky bought with perfect good-humor, discounting
at the recognized tariff, but always with solemn eyes, and a
mind still wondering at his overnight interview with Wild
Bill. He had obeyed him implicitly, knowing that he was
making a liberal profit for himself, whatever the gambler
might be risking. All his transactions were guaranteed for
him by the small fortune which Bill possessed safely deposited
in the Spawn City bank. Well, it was not for him
to hesitate.</p>
<p>But his trading was not carried on without comment and
questioning. Besides which, there was a heap of rough
sarcasm and satire to put up with from his customers. But
he put up with it. He could afford to. And to the closest
questioning he had always one answer, and no enlightenment
could they drag out of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stage goes, boys,&#8221; he told them. &#8220;An&#8217; personal,
I ain&#8217;t scairt a cent&#8217;s-worth of James an&#8217; his gang. Though,
to see the way you&#8217;se fellers are fallin&#8217; over yourselves to
make trade with me, I guess I know some folks as is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The marvel of the whole thing confounded the public
mind. But the selfishness of human nature demanded that
advantage should be taken of the situation. If Minky, who
recently had jibbed at trading gold, had suddenly eased the
market, well, it was &#8220;up to him.&#8221; It was his &#8220;funeral.&#8221;
The public jumped at the chance of realizing, and so relieving
themselves of the cloud of trouble threatening them.
James could come along with a whole army of desperadoes,
once they had rid themselves of their &#8220;dust.&#8221; They then
would no longer have anything to lose except their lives, and
those they were always prepared to risk in anything so
enterprising as a little honest gun-play.</p>
<p>It was noon when Wild Bill was stirring. And he listened
to the news which greeted him on every hand with a
calmly non-committal air. Nor, when he found it necessary
to comment, did he hesitate to do so in his usual sharp,
decided fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Minky&#8217;s good grit,&#8221; he declared on one occasion to a
puzzled miner. &#8220;I don&#8217;t guess ther&#8217;s many folks around as
&#8217;ud take his chances. I allow Sufferin&#8217; Creek needs to be
proud of sech a feller.&#8221;</p>
<p>And his attitude promptly set up a new feeling in the
camp. Minky&#8217;s heroic pose had not struck the people before.
But now the full force of it struck home in a manner
which suddenly raised him to a great pinnacle of
popularity. The storekeeper of Suffering Creek was standing
between the camp and possible financial disaster. It
was noble. It was splendid. Yes, they had reason to be
very thankful to him.</p>
<p>Bill contemplated the notice long and earnestly when his
attention was first called to it. And his narrow eyes lit and
twinkled as he read down the carefully chalked capitals.
Minky had certainly done it well. But then Minky did
most things well. He read it down a second time, and then
pushed his way into the store. It was some time before he
could reach his friend, but finally he got him to himself as he
was poring over a big cash-book. The storekeeper looked
up. Nor had he any greeting for his visitor. He was still
dazed at the gambler&#8217;s purpose. And somehow it was the
latter who had to speak first.</p>
<p>&#8220;You done it good, Minky,&#8221; he said amiably.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217;ll be sixty thousand dollars,&#8221; the storekeeper
mumbled doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221; Bill turned and gazed out of the window. &#8220;It
needs to be a big pile. Makes things surer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surer? I don&#8217;t get you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; that&#8217;s so.&#8221; The gambler turned back to the other
abruptly. &#8220;Say, you get busy an&#8217; gas. Gas till you got the
camp yappin&#8217; like coyotes. Tell &#8217;em the stage is sure carryin&#8217;
sixty thousand dollars&#8217; worth o&#8217; good red gold.&#8221; Then
his manner suddenly changed and he laughed. &#8220;Say, I&#8217;m
jest goin&#8217; out to get a peek at my claim. I sure guess I
bought a dandy rich claim o&#8217; Zip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You orter know,&#8221; said Minky, with a shake of the head.
&#8220;I sure don&#8217;t seem to understand&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Course you don&#8217;t,&#8221; cried Bill, with strange good-nature.
Then his eyes became curiously reflective. &#8220;Wher&#8217;s Zip?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Zip? Guess he&#8217;s around with the kids. Y&#8217;see, the
Bird&#8217;s helpin&#8217; him fix things. Maybe they&#8217;re back in the
dinin&#8217;-room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill stood for a moment in deep thought. Then he turned
suddenly, and his fierce little eyes fixed themselves on his
friend&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Them kids,&#8221; he said sharply. &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;ll get you to
kep &#8217;em safe right here fer three days an&#8217; more. After that
we&#8217;ll see.&#8221; Then in a moment his expression lightened and
he laughed. &#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll get Zip to come along an&#8217; show
me the claim.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Half-an-hour later the gambler was striding down the
river bank, with Scipio hurrying along at his side. Several
times the little man had endeavored to engage his companion
in amiable conversation. He wanted to talk about the episode
at the river, but Bill would have none of it. Nor was
it until he was nearly half-way to their destination, where
Sandy Joyce was already at work, that he broke the silence
in which he had wrapped himself.</p>
<p>They had just emerged from a narrow cattle-track where
they had been forced to walk in single file on account of the
bush which grew in such abundance on either side of it. Bill
was leading, and as the path widened into a clearing, in
which lay several fallen trees rooted out of the ground by
some long-passed flood of the creek, he suddenly turned
about and faced his diminutive friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll set here a piece. Guess we need
to talk some.&#8221; He glanced quickly about, and finally flung
himself upon the nearest tree-trunk. &#8220;Set,&#8221; he cried, pointing
at another trunk lying opposite to him.</p>
<p>Scipio wonderingly complied. He stood in considerable
awe of the gambler, and now he was ransacking his brain to
discover the object of this desire for a talk. He could find
no adequate reason, except it might be that Bill was repenting
of his bargain in purchasing a half-share in his claim.
Yes, it might be that. It probably was that. He had no
doubt bought on inaccurate information. Scipio knew how
misleading and how wild many of the reports which flew
about Suffering Creek were. Besides, he was certain that
Bill&#8217;s information about his claim, wherever he had got it
from, was inaccurate. Yes, no doubt this was what he
wanted to talk about, and the honest-minded man promptly
decided that the gambler should have no cause to blame him.
He need have no doubts. He would by no means hold him
to the bargain. He would return the money&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Suddenly he remembered. He had already spent five
dollars of it, and he went hot and cold at the thought. He
had nothing with which to replace it.</p>
<p>However, he took no further thought, and, as Bill still
remained silent, he plunged into the matter at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got most all the money with me,&#8221; he began, in his
vague way expecting the other to understand his meaning.
&#8220;That is, all but fi&#8217; dollars. Y&#8217;see, the kids needed&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill&#8217;s sharp eyes reached his face with a jump.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wot in the name o&#8217; blazes&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>But Scipio did not let him continue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew ther&#8217; wa&#8217;n&#8217;t no gold showin&#8217; on my claim,&#8221; he
hurriedly explained. &#8220;So I&#8217;ll jest hand you back your
dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Square-toed mackinaw!&#8221; the gambler cried, his face
scarlet. Then he broke out into one of his harsh laughs.
&#8220;Say,&#8221; he went on, with pretended severity, &#8220;you can&#8217;t
squeal that way. I&#8217;m in ha&#8217;f your claim, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t lettin&#8217;
up my holt on it fer&ndash;&ndash;fer nobody an&#8217; nuthin&#8217;. Get that
right here. You can&#8217;t bluff me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio flushed. He somehow felt very small. The last
thing he wanted Bill to think was that he was trying to do
him an injury.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he said helplessly. &#8220;Y&#8217;see, I thought, you
needing to talk to me so bad, you wanted, maybe, to quit
my claim.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned away, gazing down the wood-lined river.
Somehow he could not face the gambler&#8217;s stern eyes. Had
he seen the sudden softening in them the moment the other
was sure he was unobserved, he might have been less troubled.
But the gambler had no soft side when men&#8217;s eyes
were upon him.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t about your claim I need to talk,&#8221; Bill said, after
a brief pause. His voice was less harsh, and there was an
unusual thoughtfulness in its tone. &#8220;It&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;Say,
Zip, I ain&#8217;t fergot our talk out there on the trail.&#8221; He
nodded his head out in the direction of Spawn City. &#8220;You
mind that talk when you was puttin&#8217; up that fool proposition
o&#8217; handin&#8217; James that kid?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio&#8217;s eyes had come back to his companion, and their
expression had suddenly dropped to one of hopeless regret.
His heart was stirred to its depths by the reference to the past
trouble which lay like a cankerous sore so deep down in it.</p>
<p>He nodded. But otherwise he had no words.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re needin&#8217; your wife?&#8221; Bill went on brusquely.</p>
<p>Again Scipio nodded. But this time words came, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you was right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I saw it all after. I
was plumb wrong. An&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t holding you to&ndash;&ndash;what
you said. You jest wanted to put me right. I understood
that&ndash;&ndash;after.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill stirred uneasily, and kicked a protruding limb of the
tree on which he sat.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a heap ready to let me out,&#8221; he cried, with a
return to his harshest manner. &#8220;Who in blazes are you to
say I don&#8217;t need to do the&ndash;&ndash;things I said I&#8217;d do? Jest wait
till you&#8217;re ast to.&#8221; He turned away, and Scipio was left
troubled and wondering.</p>
<p>But suddenly the lean body swung round again, and the
little prospector felt the burning intensity of the man&#8217;s eyes
as they concentrated on his flushing face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re needin&#8217; your wife?&#8221; he jerked out.</p>
<p>&#8220;More&#8217;n all the world,&#8221; the little man cried, with emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you put up a&ndash;&ndash;a scrap fer her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>The corners of Bill&#8217;s mouth wrinkled, but his eyes remained
hard and commanding. Whatever feelings of an
appreciative nature lay behind his lean face they were well
hidden.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d face James an&#8217; all his gang&ndash;&ndash;again? You&#8217;d face
him if it sure meant&ndash;&ndash;death?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The chance o&#8217; death wouldn&#8217;t stop me if I could get her
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>The quiet of the little man&#8217;s tone carried a conviction far
greater than any outburst could have done.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; she&#8217;s been&ndash;&ndash;his?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio took a deep breath. His hands clenched. Just for
a moment the whites of his eyes became bloodshot with
some rush of tremendous feeling. It seemed as though he
were about to break out into verbal expression of his agony
of heart. But when he finally did speak it was in the same
even tone, though his breath came hard and deep.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want her&ndash;&ndash;whatever she is,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>
<p>Bill rose to his feet, and a passionate light shone in his
sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then take Minky&#8217;s mule an&#8217; buckboard. Start right out
fer James&#8217; ranch before sun-up Wednesday mornin&#8217;, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ll
sure get her. Come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio sprang to his feet, and a dozen hot questions
leapt to his mind. An ocean of gratitude was struggling to
pour from his inadequate tongue, but Bill would have none
of it. He waved him aside and set off for their destination,
and the other could only follow. But at the farther edge of
the clearing again the gambler paused. This time a sudden
thought had changed his plans. He turned abruptly, and
without one particle of softening in his manner he ordered
him back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t no use fer you to get around
further. You ken jest light back to the store, an&#8217; see to
them kids. Don&#8217;t you never let &#8217;em out o&#8217; your sight till
Wednesday come. Then hit out fer James&#8217; ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Wild Bill eventually reached the claim, he found
Sandy sitting on an upturned bucket amidst the most deplorable
surroundings in which a gold prospector in quest of the
precious metal could ever hope to find himself.</p>
<p>The creek bank was some two hundred yards away, with
a pronounced rising ground between him and it. Behind
him was a great cut-faced rock of ironstone that certainly
looked auriferous. The base of it lay in a definite hollow,
reed-grown and oozy. Beyond him, to the right, following
the river bank, the ground declined gradually towards a
black-looking, turgid and overgrown swamp. While, from
the direction in which the gambler approached, a low, dense,
thorny bush grew, made up of branches almost skeleton in
their lack of leaves. It was a forlorn and uninviting spot,
calculated to dishearten anybody with a heart less big and
an enthusiasm less vital than Scipio&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Bill stood for a moment surveying the scene before Sandy
realized his presence. And that first glance set him snorting
contemptuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, say&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he began. But words failed him, and he
hurried across to his &#8220;hired&#8221; man.</p>
<p>Sandy jumped up as he came near, and before the other
could stop him had poured out his opinion of things in general,
and that claim in particular, in a few well-chosen and
effective words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Zip orter sure be shot or hanged,&#8221; he cried angrily,
&#8220;an&#8217; this doggone claim o&#8217; mud needs to be boosted through
a dogasted volcany an&#8217; blowed out the other side o&#8217; no sort
o&#8217; place at all. Ther&#8217; sure ain&#8217;t nuthin&#8217; worse in the world
than the foolishness of a tow-headed fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Bill ignored the outburst.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much gold you found?&#8221; he inquired coldly.</p>
<p>Sandy&#8217;s indignant eyes blazed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gold? Pea-shucks!&#8221; he roared, with a furious oath.
&#8220;An&#8217; I tell you right here I ain&#8217;t to be made no fool of.
You ken take this mule-headed job an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;well, you ken
take it. I quit right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>But again Bill ignored his outburst. There was not a
vestige of expression in his face as he moved across to the
mouth of a shaft Scipio had been sinking before his work
had been interrupted by the going of his wife. He looked
into it and pointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you best get right on makin&#8217; this hole deeper.
Ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t nuthin&#8217; like diggin&#8217; to find out. Zip&#8217;s sure a
wise guy. I don&#8217;t guess I know what you&#8217;ll likely find&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;you
best kep diggin&#8217;. That&#8217;s sure his notion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy went purple in the face, and spluttered violently
in his attempt to speak. Finally, when he did get his words
out, it was only to repeat his decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s jest a mud swamp,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;an&#8217; I quit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill turned swiftly. His movements were almost cat-like
as he came up and peered into Sandy&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll kep right on diggin&#8217; that hole,&#8221; he said, with an
icy threat. &#8220;An&#8217; come Wednesday you&#8217;ll quit diggin&#8217; an&#8217;
hit the trail on Zip&#8217;s track&ndash;&ndash;you an&#8217; Sunny an&#8217; Toby&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;
you&#8217;ll sure see no harm comes to him. But he ain&#8217;t to see
you, nor to know you&#8217;re chasin&#8217; him. An&#8217; you ain&#8217;t to stop
him, no matter what fool trick he gets playin&#8217;. Get me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy&#8217;s choler died out before the other&#8217;s purpose. He
suddenly realized that his work on the claim was not of any
great consequence to his employer, that Bill had other
thoughts, other schemes in his head, and that he, Sandy,
was to have his place in them. He nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I get you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t no &#8216;buts,&#8217;&#8221; interrupted Bill. &#8220;You&#8217;re goin&#8217;
to do as I sez. Meanwhiles you&#8217;re goin&#8217; right on diggin&#8217;
that hole, to earn your dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>And without another word he turned and hurried away
towards the mouth of the trail whence he had appeared.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>SUSPENSE</h3>
</div>
<p>It was nearly sundown. A chilly mist was stealing down
the slopes of the surrounding hills. It densified to a ruddy
fog as it caught the glow of the evening sun, and finally
settled upon the valley. And with each passing moment the
hills seemed to recede, their outlines to grow more indistinct
and ghostly. And gradually the whole prospect took on the
depressing aspect of a day dying wearily.</p>
<p>Had Jessie been less preoccupied as she stood at the door
of the ranch-house she might have felt something of all this.
But she heeded nothing of the hour, and saw nothing of the
picture before her. Her eyes only visualized the scenes that
a world of troubled and apprehensive thought yielded her.
Her mind and heart were full of a great terror, a terror
which left her helpless and dazed.</p>
<p>She stirred restlessly. Time and again she changed her
position. Now she was leaning against one casing of the
doorway, now against the other. A nervous glance over her
shoulder, as some sound in the darkness of the room behind
her set her shivering, told of the state of her nerves, as also,
with ears ever on the alert, her fearful glances at a definite
spot in the rapidly dimming hills told of a straining, harassed
expectancy. Her nerves were almost at breaking-point.
Her handsome face was drawn and haggard. All the youthful
freshness seemed to have vanished from it forever, leaving
her radiant eyes shadowed and hopeless. It was a
painful change. But the outward and visible signs were
nothing to the changes that had taken place within her.</p>
<p>Thirty yards away a decrepit choreman was making pretense
of some work upon a corral fence. But it was only
pretense. His real occupation was espionage. His red-rimmed
eyes never for a moment lost sight of his master&#8217;s
woman when she showed herself in the open. A curious-looking
dog of immense proportions, half mastiff, half Newfoundland,
squatted on its haunches at his side, alternating
his green-eyed attention between a watchful regard for the
hand that fed and thrashed it and the woman at the doorway.
There was not much to choose between the faces of these
wardens of the ranch. Both were cruel, both were intensely
vicious. In neither pair of eyes was there any friendliness
for the woman. And it needed little imagination to understand
that both possessed to the full all the instincts of the
savage watch-dog.</p>
<p>But Jessie had no thought for either. Her own terrible
thoughts and feelings held her. It is doubtful if she was
even aware of their presence at all. Just now one thought
stood out dominant in her mind. She was expecting the
return of&ndash;&ndash;James. And the return of James meant&ndash;&ndash;She
shuddered.</p>
<p>He was returning from his expedition in the neighborhood
of Suffering Creek, and this knowledge brought with it the
remembrance that his object was to give her possession of
at least one of her children. Distracted as she was with
her mother&#8217;s desire for possession of her offspring, although
the man was now only obeying her expressed wishes, she
dreaded the child&#8217;s coming almost as much as she dreaded
her lover&#8217;s return. The thought of seeing Vada in this
man&#8217;s arms maddened her to such a degree that she was
well-nigh beside herself.</p>
<p>For two whole days now had she brooded under a cloud
of despair. She had scarcely stirred out of her room; she
had eaten scarcely enough to sustain life. She had shut herself
up, a prey to harrowing remorse and terror&ndash;&ndash;a remorse
which she knew to be as useless as her terror was nerve-racking.
Her awakening had come, sudden, awful. And,
like all such awakenings, it had come too late, so that the
horror of her future was written in letters of fire before her
mental eyes, a fire which burnt into her broken heart and
left her in the depths of an unutterable despair.</p>
<p>It was on the morning of her lover&#8217;s departure for the
region of Suffering Creek that the awakening had come. It
had come with an overwhelming rush of horror which, in
the midst of her dressing, had sent her reeling and fainting
upon the bed from which she had only just risen, and where
for two hours she had subsequently lain in a state of
collapse.</p>
<p>She was brushing her hair, her mind busy with the pleasant
thought that shortly she was to have one of her children
with her again. She knew that her appeal to her husband
had failed, but James had sworn to keep his promise, and
now he was setting out for that expressed purpose. And
such was her foolish woman&#8217;s blind faith that she had no
doubts. When he returned he was to bring, at least, little
Vada with him. The fresh mountain air was doubly pleasant
to her that morning. The brilliant sunlight raised her
spirits. All qualms of conscience were thrust into the background,
and she was as nearly happy as earthly interest
could make her.</p>
<p>She could see the crowded corrals from where she stood.
She could hear the bellowing of the restless cattle as they
pushed and horned each other in their forceful, bovine desire
to get out to the succulent grass of their beloved pastures.
All the men were astir, preparing for their lawless expedition.
The saddle-horses, ready for the trail, were hitched to
the corral fences. Through the open window she could hear
her lover ordering and hectoring, as was his way of dealing
with the ruffians who served under his leadership; and a
thrill of excitement, a subtle sympathy, stirred her. She
moved to the window, leaving her beautiful hair flowing in
the bright air, and stood watching for the departure.</p>
<p>Then came that hideous thing which was to shadow all her
future life. It came almost without warning. In a flash, it
seemed, the last tinge of romance was swept from her
thoughts, and the hideous skeleton of reality was laid bare.</p>
<p>The men had tightened up the cinchas of their saddles,
and passed the reins over their horses&#8217; heads, ready to
mount. She watched them all with something very like admiration
in her blinded eyes. Their hard, desperate faces
did not appear so to her. These things, in her foolish mind,
were the hall-mark of reckless courage, of strong, virile manhood.
They were men who feared nothing, who cared no
more for their own lives than they would care for the life of
an enemy. And somehow this seemed to her just as it
should be.</p>
<p>She waited to see them mount their raw-boned bronchos.
But somehow there was a delay; and in this delay a change
came over the scene. The men drifted away from their
horses and gathered into groups. They stood whispering
together with faces averted from their leader. A feeling of
apprehension somehow caught hold of her. She did not
understand why, but she felt that all was not right. She
turned to James, and saw that he was moving round his
horse all unconcernedly, and she wondered if he were aware
of the change in his men.</p>
<p>But all further speculation was abruptly checked, for at
that moment she heard the leader issue one of his sharp
orders. She did not quite catch his words, but she noticed
that no one moved or attempted to comply. Only talk
ceased instantly. Then she saw the handsome face of her
lover flush, as he glanced about him at this unusual phenomenon,
and in a moment she recognized the sudden savage
anger that flashed into his eyes. Simultaneously his hand
dropped to the butt of one of his guns.</p>
<p>Then she heard his words, as they were shouted to the
accompaniment of a string of vicious oaths.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho, you, Ned, an&#8217; you, too, Sully!&#8221; he cried fiercely,
&#8220;get your ears flappin&#8217;. Huyk that rotten skunk Conroy
out. I ain&#8217;t tellin&#8217; you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman had thrilled at his words. There was such
command, such fearlessness in them, in his whole poise.
She felt, too, that there was trouble looming. There was
rebellion in the air. Her excitement rose, and her sympathies
were all for this one man.</p>
<p>The two men indicated suddenly bestirred themselves, and
moved off under their leader&#8217;s eye. The rest drifted together&ndash;&ndash;eight
of them, she found herself counting. And
as they drew together a murmur arose.</p>
<p>Instantly James&#8217; gun flew from its holster; and he stood,
the personification of cold authority.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another word an&#8217; I empty this into your lousy hides!&#8221;
she heard him cry. And instantly the murmur died out.</p>
<p>But the threatening weapon did not return to its holster.
James stood there waiting. And presently she beheld the
two men he had despatched returning, bringing in their custody,
tottering awkwardly between them, the man Abe Conroy,
with his arms tightly fastened behind his back, and a
pair of horse-hobbles securing his ankles. They came
slowly, for the hobbles allowed but little play, and halted
less than five yards away from their leader.</p>
<p>As they paused the woman shivered. Some premonition
of what was about to happen got hold of her, and struck
terror to her heart. She stood staring now, unable to move.
A hideous fascination seemed to paralyze her.</p>
<p>The next thing that reached her comprehension was that
James was speaking in a harsh metallic voice. She had
never heard him speak like that before, and her fears swiftly
increased as his words floated in through the open window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you skunk,&#8221; he was saying, &#8220;you guess you&#8217;re
man enough to run this lay-out. You guess you&#8217;re a bigger
man than me. You guess you got me squealin&#8217; around like
a suckin&#8217; kid. You! An&#8217; I took you out o&#8217; jail, wher&#8217; they
was goin&#8217; to set you swingin&#8217;. Gee! I could tell you a
heap, but I ain&#8217;t no time talkin&#8217; to bastards of your kidney.
Swingin&#8217;s too good fer sech as you. Anyway, when I got
work to do I do it myself. Here, you, Ned, an&#8217; you, Sully,
stand aside!&#8221;</p>
<p>She saw the two men withdraw. She wanted to scream,
without quite knowing why. But no sound came. Her eyes
were starting out of her head with the horror of what she
knew to be about to happen. But she had no power to stir
hand or foot.</p>
<p>She saw James move forward. She saw the bloodless,
horror-stricken face of the prisoner. She saw him stumble
as he attempted to move away. There was no escape.</p>
<p>James moved forward with body crouching, and strides
that covered the intervening space with almost feline stealth.</p>
<p>He came right up to the man, his gun leading. She heard
a report and one dreadful cry of terror and pain. She saw
Conroy crumple and fall writhing upon the ground. She
saw the blood streaming from his stomach. Then the further
horror came to her staring eyes as she saw James stand
over his victim and fire shot after shot into the hideous,
writhing heap.</p>
<p>But the limit was reached. With one wild scream she
turned away and flung herself upon her bed; and the next
moment everything mercifully became a blank to her.</p>
<p>That was on the Sunday morning. She saw nothing of
what followed. She knew nothing until she awoke some
two hours later to the haunting vision of the scene she had
witnessed. And ever since it had clung to her&ndash;&ndash;clung like
an obsession, a mental parasite sapping her nerve, her very
reason. Nor had she power to disassociate herself from it.</p>
<p>And now she was waiting in an agony of mind for the
murderer&#8217;s return. Not only was she waiting for his return,
but she expected to see him bearing in his arms one of her
own innocent children. The thought of little Vada in his
arms drove her frantic. Her innocent little Vada in the
arms of this cold-blooded assassin!</p>
<p>She knew him now for all he was. The scales had fallen
from her foolish eyes. All the romance of his hideous calling
had passed in a flash, and she saw it as it was. She had
no words to express her feelings of horror and revolting.
In her weakness and wickedness she had torn herself out of
the life of a good man to fling herself upon the bosom of
this black-hearted villain. She loathed him; she loathed his
very name. But more than all else she loathed herself.
Her punishment was terrible. She was so helpless, so
powerless. She knew it, and the knowledge paralyzed her
thought. What could she do? She knew she was watched,
and any move to get away would be at once frustrated.
She could do nothing&ndash;&ndash;nothing.</p>
<p>No longer able to remain in her room, she had come out
to breathe air which she vainly hoped was less contaminated
with the crimes of the man whose home she had elected to
share. But inside or out it made no difference. The haunting
was not of the place. It was in her mind; it had enveloped
her whole consciousness.</p>
<p>But through it all there was one longing, one yearning for
all that she had lost, all she had wantonly thrown away.
Suffering Creek, with its poverty-stricken home on the
dumps, suggested paradise to her now. She yearned as only
a mother can yearn for the warm caresses of her children.
She longed for the honest love of the little man whom, in the
days of her arrogant womanhood, she had so mercilessly
despised. All his patient kindliness came back to her now.
All his tremendous, if misdirected, effort on her behalf, his
never-failing loyalty and courage, were things which to her,
in her misery, were the most blessed of all blessings. She
wanted home&ndash;&ndash;home. And in that one bitter cry of her
heart was expressed the awakening of her real womanhood.</p>
<p>But it had come too late&ndash;&ndash;too late. There was no home
now for her but the home of this man. There was no
husband for her, only the illicit love of this man. Her children&ndash;&ndash;she
could only obtain them by a theft. And as this
last thought came to her she remembered who it was who
must commit the theft.</p>
<p>The thought brought a fresh terror. How would he
accomplish his end? Had not Scipio tacitly refused to yield
up her children? Then how&ndash;&ndash;how? She shivered. She
knew the means James would readily, probably only too
gladly, adopt. Her husband, the little harmless man who
had always loved her, would be swept aside like anyone else
who stood in the way. James would shoot him down as he
had shot Conroy down; even, she fancied, he would shoot
him down for the wanton amusement of destroying his
life.</p>
<p>Oh no, no! It was too horrible. He was her husband,
the first man she had ever cared for. She thought of all
they had been to each other. Her mind sped swiftly over
past scenes which had so long been forgotten. She remembered
his gentleness, his kindly thought for her, his self-effacement
where her personal comforts were in question,
his devotion both to herself and her children. Every detail
of their disastrous married life sped swiftly before her
straining mental vision, leaving the man standing out something
greater than a hero to her yearning heart. And she
had flung it all away in a moment of passion. She had
blinded herself in the arrogance of her woman&#8217;s vanity.
Gone, gone. And now she was the mistress of a common
assassin.</p>
<p>So she lashed herself with the torture of repentance and
regret as the darkness fell. She did not stir from her post.
The damp of the mist was unnoticed, the chill of the air.
She was waiting for that return which was to claim her to
an earthly hell, than which she could conceive no greater&ndash;&ndash;waiting
like the condemned prisoner, numb, helpless, fearful
lest the end should come unobserved.</p>
<p>The ranch wardens waited, too. The man cursed his
charge with all the hatred of an evil nature, as the damp
penetrated to his mean bones. The dog, too, grew restless,
but where his master was, there was his place. He had long
since learned that&ndash;&ndash;to his cost.</p>
<p>The night crept on, and there was no change in the position,
except that the man sought the sheltering doorway of
one of the barns, and covered his damp shirt with a jacket.
But the woman did not move. She was beyond all conception
of time. She was beyond any thought of personal comfort
or fatigue. All she knew was that she must wait&ndash;&ndash;wait
for the coming of her now hated lover, that at least she
might snatch her child from his contaminating arms. And
after that&ndash;&ndash;well, after that&ndash;&ndash;She had no power to think
of the afterwards.</p>
<p>The moon rose amidst the obscurity of the fog. It
mounted, and at last reached a height where its silvery light
could no longer be denied by the low-lying mists. But its
reign was brief. Its cold splendor rapidly began to shrink
before the pink dawn, and in less than two hours it was but
a dim white circle set in the azure of the new-born day.</p>
<p>Still the woman remained at her post, her dark eyes straining
with her vigil. She was drenched to the skin with the
night-mists, but the chill of her body was nothing to the chill
of her heart. The spy was still at his post in the barn doorway,
but he was slumbering, as was his canine servitor, lying
curled up at his feet. The sun rose, the mists cleared. And
now the warming of day stirred the cattle in the corrals.</p>
<p>Suddenly the waiting woman started. Her attention had
never once relaxed. She moved out with stiffened joints,
and, shading her eyes with her hand, stared into the gleaming
sunlight. Her ears had caught the distant thud of
horses&#8217; hoofs, and now her eyes confirmed. Away down
the valley she could see the dim outline of a number of
horsemen riding towards the ranch.</p>
<p>Her heart began to thump in her bosom, and her limbs
quaked under her. What could she do? What must she do?
Every thought, every idea that her long vigil had suggested
was swept from her mind. A blank helplessness held her in
its grip. She could only wait for what was to come.</p>
<p>The pounding of hoofs grew louder, the figures grew
bigger. They were riding out of the sun, and her eyes were
almost blinded as she looked for that which she trembled to
behold. She could not be certain of anything yet, except
that the return of her lover was at hand.</p>
<p>Nearer, nearer they came. Nearer, nearer still. Then
suddenly a sharp exclamation broke from the watcher. It
was a cry which had in it a strange thrill. It might have
been the gasp of the condemned man at the sound of the
word &#8220;reprieve.&#8221; It might have been the cry of one momentarily
relieved from years of suffering.</p>
<p>She could see them plainly. For now the figures were
no longer silhouetted against the sun. They had changed
their course as they neared the ranch, and the rising sun was
well clear. She could even recognize them by their horses.
She counted. There were ten of them. One was missing.
Who? But her interest was only momentary. She recognized
the leader, and after that nothing else concerned her.</p>
<p>She could not mistake him. He sat his dark brown horse
differently to anybody else. He looked to be part of it.
But there was no admiration in her eyes. And yet there
was an expression in them that had not been in them since
his departure. There was hope in her eyes, and something
akin to joy in her whole attitude. James was riding empty-handed!</p>
<p>Hence her cry. But now she glanced swiftly at each
horseman, to be sure that they, too, were empty-handed.
Yes, each man was riding with the loose swinging arms of
the prairie man. And with a sigh that contained in it every
expression of an unbounded relief she turned and vanished
into the house. For the time, at least, Vada was safe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>JAMES</h3>
</div>
<p>James clattered into the empty sitting-room and stared
about him. His dark face was flushed with excitement.
The savage in him was stirred to its best mood, but it was
still the savage. He grinned as he realized that the room
was empty, and it was a grin of amusement. Some thought
in his mind gave him satisfaction, in spite of the fact that
there was no one to greet him.</p>
<p>The grin passed and left him serious. Even his excitement
had abated. He had remembered Jessie&#8217;s scream at
the scene she must have witnessed. He remembered that he
had left her fainting. With another quick glance round he
stood and called&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho, you! Jess!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no answer; and he called again, this time his
handsome face darkening. He had seen her from a distance
outside the house, so there was no doubt of her being about.</p>
<p>Still he received no answer.</p>
<p>An oath followed. But just as he was about to call again
he heard the sound of a skirt beyond the inner door. Instantly
he checked his impulse, and where before his swift-rising
anger had shone in his eyes a smile now greeted Jessie
as she opened the door and entered the room.</p>
<p>For a moment no verbal greeting passed between them.
The man was taking in every detail of her face and figure,
much as a connoisseur may note the points of some precious
purchase he is about to make, or a glutton may contemplate
a favorite dish. He saw nothing in her face of the effects
of the strain through which she had passed. To him her
eyes were the same wonderful, passionate depths that had
first drawn his reckless manhood to flout every risk in hunting
his quarry down. Her lips were the same rich, moist,
enticing lips he had pressed to his in those past moments of
passion. The rounded body was unchanged. Yes, she was
very desirable.</p>
<p>But he was too sure of his ground to notice that there was
no responsive admiration in the woman&#8217;s eyes. And perhaps
it was as well. She was looking at him with eyes wide open
to what he really was, and all the revolting of her nature
was uppermost. She loathed him as she might some venomous
reptile. She loathed him and feared him. His body
might have been the body of an Apollo, his face the most
perfect of God&#8217;s creations. She knew him now for the cold-blooded
murderer he was, and so she loathed and feared him.</p>
<p>There were stains upon his cotton shirt-sleeves, upon the
bosom of it showing between the fronts of his unbuttoned
waistcoat. There were stains upon his white moleskin
trousers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blood,&#8221; she said, pointing. And something of her feelings
must have been plain to any but his infatuated ears.</p>
<p>He laughed. It was a cruel laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;It was a great scrap. We took
nigh a hundred head of Sid Morton&#8217;s cattle and burnt him
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the blood?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess it must be his, or&ndash;&ndash;Luke Tedby&#8217;s.&#8221; His face
suddenly darkened. &#8220;That mutton-headed gambler over on
Suffering Creek did him up. I had to carry him to shelter&ndash;&ndash;after
he got away.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jessie paid little attention. She was following up her
own thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;Conroy&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>James&#8217; eyes grew cold.</p>
<p>&#8220;That seems to worry you some,&#8221; he cried coldly. Then
he put the thing aside with a laugh. &#8220;You&#8217;ll get used to
that sort of talk after you&#8217;ve been here awhile. Say, Jes&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can never get used to&ndash;&ndash;murder.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s eyes were alight with a somber fire. She
had no idea of whither her words and feelings were carrying
her. All her best feelings were up in arms, and she, too, was
touched now with the reckless spirit which drove these people.
There was no hope for her future. There was no
hope whithersoever she looked. And now that she had seen
her children were still safe from the life she had flung herself
into, she cared very little what happened to her.</p>
<p>But the cruel despot, to whom life and death were of no
account whatsoever, was not likely to deal tenderly long with
the woman he desired did she prove anything but amenable.
Now her words stung him as they were meant to sting, and
his mouth hardened.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re talking foolish,&#8221; he cried in that coldly metallic
way she had heard him use before. &#8220;Conroy got all he
needed. Maybe he deserved more. Anyhow, ther&#8217;s only
one man running this lay-out, and I&#8217;m surely that man.
Say&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; again he changed. This time it was a change back
to something of the lover she knew, and at once he became
even more hateful to her&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;things missed fire at&ndash;&ndash;the
Creek. I didn&#8217;t get hands on your kids. I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad.&#8221; Jessie could have shouted aloud her joy, but
the man&#8217;s look of surprise brought caution, and she qualified
her words. &#8220;No; we&#8217;d best leave them, after all,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;You see, these men&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked fearlessly into his face. She was acting as
only a woman can act when the object of her affections is
threatened.</p>
<p>And her lover warmed all unsuspiciously. It would have
been better for her had she only realized her power over him.
But she was not clever. She was not even brave.</p>
<p>James nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he said; and with that monosyllable dismissed
the subject from his mind for matters that gave him savage
delight. &#8220;Say, we&#8217;ve had a good round-up,&#8221; he went on&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;a
dandy haul. But we&#8217;re going to do better&ndash;&ndash;Oh yes,
much better.&#8221; Then his smile died out. He had almost
forgotten the woman in the contemplation of what he had in
his mind. This man was wedded to his villainies. They
came before all else. Jessie was his; he was sure of her.
She was his possession, and he took her for granted now.
The excitement of his trade had once again become paramount.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess Sufferin&#8217; Creek has gone plumb crazy,&#8221; he went
on delightedly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had boys around to keep me posted.
They been spotting things. Old Minky has been sittin&#8217; so
tight I guessed I&#8217;d have to raid the store for his gold; an&#8217;
now they&#8217;ve opened out. That buzzy-headed old fool&#8217;s goin&#8217;
to send out a stage loaded down with dust. It starts
Wednesday morning, an&#8217; he guesses it&#8217;s to win through to
Spawn City. Gee! An&#8217; they&#8217;re shoutin&#8217; about it. Say,
Jess, they say it&#8217;s to carry sixty thousand dollars. Well, it
won&#8217;t carry it far. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m back here now. That&#8217;s
why I quit worrying with your kids when Wild Bill did up
Luke. We hustled home to change our plugs, an&#8217; are hittin&#8217;
the trail again right away. Sixty thousand dollars! Gee!
what a haul! Say, when I&#8217;ve taken that&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he moved a
step nearer and dropped his voice&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to clear
out of this&ndash;&ndash;you an&#8217; me. Those guys out there ain&#8217;t never
going to touch a cent. You leave that to me. We&#8217;ll hit for
New Mexico, and to hell with the north country. Say, Jess,
ain&#8217;t that fine? Fine?&#8221; he went on, with a laugh. &#8220;It&#8217;s
fine as you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had no answer for him. And he went on quite heedlessly,
lost in admiration of his own scheme, and joy at the
prospect.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll settle down to an elegant little ranch, most respectable
like. You can go to church. Ha, ha! Yes, you can
go to church all reg&#8217;lar. You can make clothes fer the poor,
an&#8217; go to sociables an&#8217; things. An&#8217; meanwhiles I can slip
across the border and gather up a few things&ndash;&ndash;just to keep
my hand in&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What time are we gettin&#8217; out?&#8221;</p>
<p>James swung round with the alertness of a panther. One
of the men was standing in the doorway, a burly ruffian
whose face was turned to his leader, but whose cruel eyes
were rudely fixed on the woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;In ha&#8217;f-an-hour,&#8221; cried James, with a swift return to his
harsh command. &#8220;Tell the boys to vittle for three days an&#8217;
roll a blanket. We&#8217;ll need &#8217;em fer sleep. An&#8217;, say,&#8221; he
cried, with sudden threat, &#8220;don&#8217;t you git around here again
till I call you. Get me?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no mistaking his anger at the interruption.
There was no mistaking his meaning. The man slunk away.
But as James turned back to the woman his previous lightness
had gone, and his ill-humor found savage expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s someone else needing a lesson besides Conroy,&#8221;
he snarled.</p>
<p>Jessie shivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t mean harm,&#8221; she protested weakly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harm? Harm? He was staring at you. You ain&#8217;t fer
sech scum as him to stare at. I&#8217;ll have to teach him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man was lashing himself to that merciless fury Jessie
had once before witnessed, and now she foolishly strove to
appease him. She laughed. It was a forced laugh, but it
served her purpose, for the man&#8217;s brow cleared instantly,
and his thoughts diverted to a full realization of her presence,
and all she meant to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can laugh,&#8221; he said, his eyes darkening with sudden
lustful passion. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t have folks&ndash;&ndash;starin&#8217; at you.
Say, Jess, you don&#8217;t know, you can&#8217;t think, how I feel about
you. You&#8217;re jest mine&ndash;&ndash;mine.&#8221; His teeth clipped together
with the force of his emotion. The brute in him
urged him as madly in his desire as it did in his harsher tempers.
&#8220;I just don&#8217;t care for nothing else but you. An&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;I
got you now. Here, you haven&#8217;t kissed me since I came
back. I&#8217;d forgot, thinking of that sixty thousand of gold-dust.
I&#8217;m off again in ha&#8217;f-an-hour&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I won&#8217;t be back
for three days. Here&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His arms were held out and he drew nearer. But now
the woman drew back in unmistakable horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he cried in a voice still passionate, yet half angry,
&#8220;you don&#8217;t need to get away. Ther&#8217;s a wall back of you.&#8221;
Then, as she still shrank back, and he saw the obvious terror
in her eyes, his swift-changing mood lost its warmth of passion
and left it only angry. &#8220;Ther&#8217;s three other walls an&#8217; a
door to this room, an&#8217; I can easy shut the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>He reached out and caught her by one arm. He swung
her to him as though she were a child. There was no escape.
She struggled to free herself, but her strength was as
the strength of a babe to his, and in a moment she was
caught in his arms and hugged to his breast. She writhed to
free herself, but her efforts made no impression. And, having
possession of her, the man laughed. It was not a pleasant
laugh. He looked down at her. Her head was thrown
back to avoid him. His hot eyes grinned tantalizingly into
her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You got to kiss me. You&#8217;re
mine. No, no, don&#8217;t you bother to kick any. You can&#8217;t get
away. Now, Jess, kiss me. Kiss me good&ndash;&ndash;good an&#8217;
plenty.&#8221; His arms crushed her closer. &#8220;What, you won&#8217;t?
You won&#8217;t kiss me? Ha, ha! Maybe that&#8217;s why you ran
back into the house when I come along. Maybe that&#8217;s why
you wouldn&#8217;t answer when I called. What&#8217;s come to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>He held her, waiting for a reply. But the woman was
beyond speech in her horror and rage. She was no longer
terrified. She was beside herself with fury and revolting.
She hated the crushing arms about her&ndash;&ndash;the arms of a murderer.
That one word stood out in her mind, maddening
her. She would not kiss him. She could not. She gasped
and struggled. She wanted to shriek for help, but that, she
knew, was useless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me go!&#8221; she cried, her voice hoarse with a fury
equal to anything he was capable of.</p>
<p>But she only held her the tighter; he only grinned the more.
He, too, was furious. He, too, meant to have his way. He
was determined she should submit.</p>
<p>Submission, however, was the farthest from her thoughts.
He bent his head forward. It came nearer to her up-thrown
chin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me go! Let me go, you&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;murderer!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was out. She had no longer any power of restraint.
And as the word hissed upon the air the man&#8217;s whole body
seemed to suddenly stiffen. His arms tightened, and she
felt her ribs bend under their terrific pressure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Murderer, eh?&#8221; she heard him cry, with an oath.
&#8220;Murderer, eh? Now you shall kiss me. Kiss me, you
wild-cat&ndash;&ndash;kiss me!&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke one hand was lifted to the back of her head.
He pressed it forward, and she was forced slowly, slowly,
fighting every inch of the way to keep her face out of reach
of his lips. His face drew nearer hers. She felt his hot
breath upon her cheeks. She shut her eyes to keep the sight
of his hated, terrifying eyes out, but ever his lips came
nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s come over you, you little fool?&#8221; he cried
fiercely. &#8220;What is it? Now, by hell! whatever it is, you
shall&ndash;&ndash;you shall kiss me.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a sudden exertion of his great strength he crushed
her face to his, and the next instant flung her from him with
a fierce cry of pain and rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;!&#8221; he shouted, as she fell in a heap against the
wall.</p>
<p>The blood was streaming from his cheek where her strong
teeth had bitten deep into the flesh. His hand went up to
the mauled flesh, and murder glared out of his eyes as he
contemplated her huddled figure lying motionless where
he had flung her. And for one second it looked as though
he intended to complete the work he had begun, and kill her
where she lay, in the same manner in which he had treated
the luckless Conroy.</p>
<p>He stared insanely at her for some moments. Then a
change came over him, and he turned to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I come back, my girl! When I come back!&#8221; he
muttered threateningly.</p>
<p>At the door he paused and looked back. But his look was
mercifully hidden from his victim by unconsciousness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>THE GOLD-STAGE</h3>
</div>
<p>Two days of excitement were quite sufficient to upset the
nerves of Suffering Creek. The only excitement it was used
to was the sudden discovery of an extra good find of gold.
The camp understood that. It was like an inspiration to the
creative worker. It stimulated the energies, it uplifted.
Any other sort of excitement had a paralyzing effect. And
thus the excitement of the present Sunday and Monday entirely
upset the rest of the week&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>Everybody felt that the happenings of those days were
merely the forerunners of something yet to come, of something
even more startling. And the restlessness of uncertainty
as to its nature kept the population hanging about the
camp, fearful that, in their absence, things might occur, and
they would miss participation in them.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Suffering Creek were a virile race,
strongly human, full of interest in passing events, and men
of appetite for any slices of life that might come their way.
So, having &#8220;cashed in&#8221; to the &#8220;limit&#8221; all the gold-dust they
possessed, they felt they were entitled to spend a few days in
watching events, and a few dollars in passing the time
until such events, if any, should come within their range of
vision.</p>
<p>What events were expected it is doubtful if the most
inventive could have put into words. The general opinion
expressed&ndash;&ndash;out of Minky&#8217;s hearing, of course, but to the
accompaniment of deep libations of his most execrable
whisky&ndash;&ndash;was that, personally, that astute trader was, for
some unaccountable reason, rapidly qualifying for the &#8220;bug-house,&#8221;
and that the only thing due from them was to display
their loyalty to him by humoring him to the extent of discounting
all the &#8220;dust&#8221; they could lay hands on, and wishing
him well out of the trouble he seemed bent on laying up for
himself. Meanwhile they would take a holiday on the proceeds
of their traffic, and, out of sheer good-fellowship,
stand by to help, or at least applaud, when the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>
came.</p>
<p>Many of the shrewder men looked to Wild Bill to give a
key to the situation. They knew him to be Minky&#8217;s closest
friend. Besides that, he was a man intensely &#8220;wide&#8221; and
far-seeing in matters pertaining to such a situation as at
present existed.</p>
<p>But Wild Bill, in this case, was the blankest of blanks in
the lottery of their draw for information. Whether this
blankness was real or affected men could not make up their
minds. The gambler was so unlike his usual self. The
hard, rough, autocratic manner of the man seemed to have
undergone a subtle change. He went about full of geniality
and a lightness his fellow-citizens had never before observed
in him. And, besides, he had suddenly become the only man
in the place who seemed to lack interest in the doings of the
James gang. Even beyond the bare facts of the outrage
down by the river on Sunday morning, he could not be
cajoled into discussing that individual or his doings.</p>
<p>No, his immediate interest apparently lay in his newly purchased
half-claim. He spent the Monday afternoon there
watching the unwilling Sandy sweating at his labors. And
on the Tuesday he even passed him a helping hand. It did
not occur to these men that Bill kept away to avoid their
cross-questionings. It only seemed to them that his new toy
had a greater fascination for him than those things which
made for the welfare of the community; that his inexperienced
eyes were blinded to the facts which were patent
enough to them: namely, that he had bought the most worthless
property in the district.</p>
<p>So they laughed, behind his back, and shrugged their great
shoulders pityingly, and their pity was also touched with
resentment that his interest in Suffering Creek could be so
easily diverted. It was Joe Brand who handed them a most
excellent laugh on the subject, though the laugh was rather
<i>at</i> than <i>with</i> him.</p>
<p>He was talking to Van and White and several other men
at one of the tables in the store. Whisky had brightened his
eyes, which had been quietly smiling for some time as the
talk of Bill went round. Then he suddenly bent forward
and arrested the general attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, boys,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;here&#8217;s a good one for you.
What&#8217;s the diff&#8217;rence between Wild Bill and Minky?&#8221;</p>
<p>Van promptly guffawed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t none. They&#8217;re sure both
&#8216;bug.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>A great laugh greeted the retort, but Joe shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;That sure ain&#8217;t the answer, but it&#8217;s real bright,&#8221; he
admitted reluctantly, while Van preened himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess they&#8217;re both that wise they don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re
comin&#8217; down or goin&#8217; up,&#8221; he went on, seeking to add to the
score he felt he had made.</p>
<p>But Joe felt he was being robbed of the fruits of his effort,
and promptly insisted upon his riddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the diff&#8217;rence between Wild Bill an&#8217; Minky?&#8221;
he asked again, this time with added emphasis.</p>
<p>He waited impatiently until one of the men shook his head,
when he snatched at the opportunity of firing his quip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he cried, with a shout of delight, &#8220;Bill&#8217;s put his
gold into a mudbank, an&#8217; Minky&#8217;s jest yearnin&#8217; to set his gold
into any old bank,&#8221; and fell back laughing furiously.</p>
<p>But he had his merriment to himself. Van, feeling he
had the company with him, sneered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! that&#8217;s the worst ever,&#8221; he cried witheringly.</p>
<p>White spat out a chew of tobacco.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d say you&#8217;re that bright you&#8217;d orter write comic Bible
trac&#8217;s,&#8221; he declared.</p>
<p>But even in his failure as a humorist Joe Brand gave
expression to the general opinion of the two men who, up
till that time, had been accounted, to use a local expression,
the &#8220;wisest guys west o&#8217; Spawn City.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly, for the time being, the mighty had fallen, and
their associates, in the persons of Sunny Oak, Toby Jenks
and Sandy Joyce, had to stand by listening to remarks
against their fellow Trust members which, though distinctly
offensive, they yet, in justice, had to admit were perfectly
warranted on the face of things. Even Scipio, mild little
man as he was, had to endure considerable chaff, which worried
and annoyed him, as to the way in which he had succeeded
in bluffing so shrewd a &#8220;guy&#8221; as Wild Bill into
purchasing half his claim.</p>
<p>But these things were only sidelights on the feelings of
the moment. Expectancy was at fever-heat, and each and
every man was wondering what was about to happen. For
though their belief in Bill and Minky had received a jolt,
long months of experience had sown in them an appreciation
that took a power of uprooting.</p>
<p>The Monday and Tuesday passed without development of
any sort. There were several conferences between the members
of the Trust, but these were really only meetings at
which the lesser members received more minute instructions
for the carrying out of their duties on the Wednesday. No
information otherwise was forthcoming for them from either
Minky or the president, and all attempt to extort any was
promptly nipped in the bud by the latter without the least
compunction or courtesy.</p>
<p>Sandy resented this attitude. Sunny complained of the
lack of confidence. But Toby sat back immensely enjoying
the chagrin of his two friends, and cordially swore that both
Minky and Bill knew a large-meshed sieve when they saw
one.</p>
<p>Tuesday night was a memorable one on Suffering Creek.
Never had there been such a gathering in Minky&#8217;s store; and
his heart must have been rejoiced to see the manner in which
so many of the dollars he had expended in the purchase of
gold-dust came fluttering back to their nest in his till. The
camp appeared to have made up its mind to an orgy of the
finest brand. Drink flowed and overflowed. The store that
night fairly swam in whisky. The flood set in the moment
supper was finished, and from that time until two o&#8217;clock in
the morning the lusty storekeeper never had a moment&#8217;s rest.</p>
<p>Men drank themselves drunk, and drank themselves sober
again. There was no poker or faro. No one wanted to
gamble. There was sufficient gamble in their minds on the
subject of to-morrow&#8217;s stage to satisfy them for the moment.
Would it get through? That was the question. And the
general opinion was an emphatic denial.</p>
<p>How could it? Had not scouts been sent out inquiring
of outlying settlers as to the prospect of a clear road? Had
not information come in that James was abroad, had been
seen in a dozen different places in the district? Had not the
belief become general that the Spawn City trail was being
carefully watched, and even patrolled, by this common
enemy? Everybody knew that these things were so. The
whole of this stage business was simply flying in the face of
Providence.</p>
<p>And amidst all the comment and talk Minky served the
requirements of his customers, wrapped in sphinx-like reserve.
His geniality never failed him. He had a pleasant
word for everybody. And at every gibe, at every warning,
he beamed and nodded, but otherwise could not be drawn
into controversy. One remark, and one only, had he for all
and sundry who chose him as a butt for their pleasantries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; he declared easily, &#8220;if I ladled out good United
States currency, to feed that bum tough James an&#8217; his crew o&#8217;
hawks, seems to me its findin&#8217; its way home right smart.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was quite true. He stood to win in every direction.
Sooner or later every cent of money he had paid out in the
purchase of gold would find its way back to him, and go to
help swell the fortune which was the effort of his life.
These men had not the commercial instinct of Minky. And,
furthermore, his meeting at night with the gambler, and its
resulting compact, was still a secret.</p>
<p>The popular laugh was for the moment against him, but
he continued to smile. And he knew that his smile would
last the longer. He would still be smiling when even the
ghost of their laugh had been laid to rest.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Sore heads were no deterrent next morning. Pillows
were deserted at an early hour. And those who had found
it convenient to pass the brief remainder of the night in their
heavy, clay-soiled boots had the advantage of breakfasting
at the first hot rush of Birdie&#8217;s ministrations. And Birdie,
with the understanding of her kind, had bestowed special attention
upon the quantity and quality of the coffee, leaving
the solid side of the meal almost unconsidered. It was her
duty to sooth parching throats, and she knew her duty.</p>
<p>It was a glorious morning. The sun rose radiant in a
cloudless sky. The air was still, so still. But the mountain
chill began to give way from the first moment that the great
arc of daylight lifted its dazzling crown above the horizon.
The quiet of the morning was perfect. It almost seemed as
if Nature itself had hushed to an expectant silence. The
woe of the night-prowling coyote at the sight of the dawn
found no voice. The frogs upon the creek had not yet begun
their morning song. Even the camp dogs, whose ceaseless
&#8220;yap&#8221; made hideous all their waking hours, for some
subtle reason moved about in quest of their morning meal as
though their success depended upon the stealth of their
movements.</p>
<p>Blear-eyed men appeared in their doorways half awake,
and only just recovering from their overnight orgy. They
stood for some moments voiceless and thoughtful. Then
the concentration upon the store began. It was strange to
look upon. It was an almost simultaneous movement.
These half-dazed, wholly sick creatures moved with the precision
of a universally impelling force. The store might
have been one huge magnet&ndash;&ndash;perhaps it was&ndash;&ndash;and these
dejected early risers mere atoms of steel.</p>
<p>But the store reached, that wonderfully revivifying hair
of the tail, etc., partaken of, and a rapid change supervened.
Quarts of coffee and some trifling solid further stimulated
jaded energies, and in less than an hour the memory that the
day was Wednesday, and that the gold-stage was to set out
upon its eventful journey, became the chief thought in every
mind. Curiosity and excitement ran riot, and questions flew
from lip to lip. How had Minky provided for the safeguarding
of his gold? Had he arranged for an adequate escort?
To whom was the gold to be entrusted?</p>
<p>The store was full of men. The veranda overflowed with
them. There were men of almost every nationality&ndash;&ndash;from
half-breed Mexicans, popularly dubbed &#8220;gorl-durned Dagos,&#8221;
to the stolid Briton, the virile New Yorker, the square-headed
Teuton, the lithe, graceful prairie man from the
Southern States. But the usual noisy discussion of the
world&#8217;s affairs, as viewed from the hidden valley in which
lay Suffering Creek, had no vital interest just now. And,
after the first rush of burning questions, a hush fell upon
the assembly, and it quickly composed itself, in various attitudes
and positions of advantage, to await, in what patience
it could, the satisfying of its curiosity.</p>
<p>Soon the hush became oppressive. It almost became a
burden. Men stirred uneasily under it; they chafed. And
at last Joe Brand found himself voicing something of the
feelings of everybody. He spoke in a whisper which, for
the life of him, he could not have raised to full voice. He
was standing next to White, and he took him confidentially
by the shoulder and spoke, leaning over till his lips were on
a level with his ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;I allow funerals is joyous things an&#8217; nigger lynchin&#8217;s is
real comic,&#8221; he declared hoarsely. &#8220;But fer real rollickin&#8217;
merriment I never see the equal o&#8217; this yer gatherin&#8217;. I sure
don&#8217;t think it &#8217;ud damp things any ef I was to give &#8217;em a
Doxology.&#8221;</p>
<p>The miner responded with a pensive smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe you&#8217;re right &#8217;bout funerals an&#8217; nigger lynchin&#8217;s,&#8221;
he whispered back, &#8220;but they&#8217;s jest a matter o&#8217; livin&#8217; an&#8217;
dyin&#8217;. Y&#8217;see, Minky&#8217;s gamblin&#8217; sixty thousand dollars o&#8217;
good red gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brand nodded. And somehow he appreciated the point
and became easier.</p>
<p>Later on Minky appeared in the store, and almost automatically
every eye was turned expectantly upon him. But
he had only come to ascertain if Wild Bill was about.</p>
<p>No, the gambler had not been seen. Someone jocularly
suggested that he and Zip were out visiting Sandy Joyce
upon their claim. None of the three had been seen that
morning. But the levity was allowed to pass without a
smile, and Minky disappeared again into the back regions of
his store.</p>
<p>After that the time passed even more slowly. The store
emptied; the men moved out into the sunlight to await the
first sight of the stage. There was nothing else to do.
Such was their saturation of the previous night that even
drink had no attraction at this early hour. So they sat or
lounged about, gazing out at the distant upland across the
river. There lay the vanishing-point of the Spawn City
trail, and beyond that they knew the danger-zone to lie. It
was a danger-zone they all understood, and, hardy as they
were, they could not understand anyone mad enough to risk
a fortune of gold within its radius. Not one of them would
have faced it singly with so little as twenty dollars in his
pocket, much less laboring under the burden of sixty thousand
dollars. And yet somebody was going to do so to-day.</p>
<p>A pounding of hoofs and crunching of wheels suddenly
swept all apathy away. Every eye lit; every head turned.
And in a moment Suffering Creek was on its feet, agog with
the intensest interest. For one brief moment the rattle and
clatter continued. Then, from round the corner, with bits
champing and satin coats gleaming in the sun, their silver-mounted
harness sparkling, Wild Bill&#8217;s treasured team of six
horses swept into view. Round they swung, hitched to his
well-known spring-cart, and in a second had drawn up with
a flourish in front of the veranda.</p>
<p>A gasp of astonishment greeted this unexpected vision.
Men stood gaping at the beaming choreman sitting perched
up on the driving-seat. It was the first time in his life he
had ever been allowed to handle the gambler&#8217;s equine children,
and his joy and pride were written in every furrow of
his age-lined features.</p>
<p>The man sat waiting, while the thoroughbreds pawed the
ground and reached restively at their bits. But they were
like babes to handle, for their manners were perfect. They
had been taught by a master-hand whose lessons had been
well learned. And the picture they made was one that inspired
admiration and envy in every eye and heart of those
who now beheld them.</p>
<p>But these were not the only emotions the sight provoked.
Blank astonishment and incredulous wonder stirred them,
too. Bill&#8217;s horses! Bill&#8217;s cart! Where&ndash;&ndash;where was the
gambler himself? Was this the stage? Was Bill&ndash;&ndash;?</p>
<p>The talk which had been so long suppressed now broke
out afresh. Everybody asked questions, but nobody answered
any. They crowded about the cart. They inspected
the horses with eyes of admiration and wonder. No man
could have withstood the sight of the rope-like veins standing
out through their velvet skin. They fondled them, and
talked to them as men will talk to horses. And it was only
when Minky suddenly appeared in their midst, bearing in
his arms an iron-clamped case which he deposited in the
body of the cart, that their attention was diverted, and they
remembered the purpose in hand.</p>
<p>The gold-chest deposited and made secure, the storekeeper
turned to the crowd about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, boys,&#8221; he said, with an amiable smile, &#8220;any more
mail? Any you fellers got things you need to send to your
sisters&ndash;&ndash;or somebody else&#8217;s sisters? You best get it ready
sharp. We&#8217;re startin&#8217; at eight o&#8217;clock. After that you&#8217;ll
sure be too late. Y&#8217;see,&#8221; he added humorously, &#8220;we ain&#8217;t
figgered when the next stage goes.&#8221; He pulled out his
nickel silver timepiece. &#8220;It&#8217;s needin&#8217; five minutes to schedule,&#8221;
he went on officially, glancing keenly down the trail.
Anyone sufficiently observant, and had they been quick
enough, might have detected a shade of anxiety in his glance.
He moved round to the side of the cart and spoke to the
man in the driving-seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nigh eight. He ain&#8217;t here?&#8221; he said questioningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess he&#8217;ll be right along, boss,&#8221; the little man returned
in a low voice.</p>
<p>Again the storekeeper glanced anxiously down the trail.
Then he turned away with a slight sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, boys,&#8221; he said, with another attempt at jocularity,
&#8220;if ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t nuthin&#8217; doin&#8217;, guess this mail&#8217;s sure closed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Passing again to the back of the cart, he gazed affectionately
upon the gold-chest. Then he lifted his eyes just as
Van voiced the question in everybody&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;You sure ain&#8217;t sendin&#8217; pore old Danny with that stage?&#8221;
he cried incredulously. &#8220;You sure ain&#8217;t sendin&#8217; him fer
James to sift lead through? You ain&#8217;t lettin&#8217; him drive
Bill&#8217;s horses?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He sure ain&#8217;t. Him drive my plugs? Him? Gee!
Ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t no one but me drives them hosses&ndash;&ndash;not if Congress
passed it a law.&#8221;</p>
<p>The harsh, familiar voice of Wild Bill grated contemptuously.
He had come up from his hut all unnoticed just in
time to hear Van&#8217;s protesting inquiry. Now he stood with
eyes only for his horses.</p>
<p>Daylight at last shone through the mist of doubt and
puzzlement which had kept the citizens of Suffering Creek
in darkness so long. They looked at this lean, harsh figure
and understood. Here was the driver of the stage, and,
curiously, with this realization their doubts of its welfare
lessened. All along they had been blaming Bill for his lack
of interest in the affairs of the camp, and now&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>They watched him with keen, narrowing eyes. What
mad game was he contemplating? They noted his dress. It
was different to that which he usually wore. His legs were
encased in sheepskin chaps. He was wearing a belt about
his waist from which hung a heavy pair of guns. And
under his black, shiny, short coat he was wearing a simple
buckskin shirt.</p>
<p>They watched him as he moved round his horses, examining
the fit of the bridles and the fastenings of the harness.
He looked to the buckles of the reins. He smoothed the
satin coats of his children with affectionate hand. Then in
a moment they saw him spring into the cart.</p>
<p>Taking the reins from the choreman, he settled himself
into the driving-seat, while the deposed charioteer clambered
stiffly to the ground.</p>
<p>Minky was at the wheel nearest to his friend. The
horses, under the master-hand, had suddenly become restive.
Bill bent over, and the storekeeper craned up towards him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217; was two fellers hit the trail this morning,&#8221; the
gambler said, with a short laugh. &#8220;I see &#8217;em when I was
with Zip&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;fore daylight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you best quit it,&#8221; said Minky in serious, anxious
tones. &#8220;We kin, maybe, hold the gold up against him here.
It ain&#8217;t too late. It ain&#8217;t, sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill&#8217;s face suddenly darkened. All the lightness which
the prospect before him had inspired suddenly left it. His
words came so full of bitter hatred that the other was
startled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for a million-dollar halo!&#8221; he cried, reaching out
for his long whip.</p>
<p>With a dexterous swing he set it cracking over his horses&#8217;
backs. The high-strung beasts plunged at their bits, and the
leaders started to rear. Again he swung out his whip, and
this time it flicked the plunging leaders. Instantly there
was a rush of feet and a scrunch of wheels. The &#8220;tugs&#8221;
pulled taut, and the gush of eager nostrils hissed like steam
upon the still air. There was a shout of farewell from the
onlookers, and the gambler turned in his seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;So long, fellers,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I&#8217;m makin&#8217; Spawn City
by daylight to-morrer&ndash;&ndash;sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next moment he was lost in a cloud of dust, as the
horses raced down the hill.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>ON THE SPAWN CITY TRAIL</h3>
</div>
<p>Wild Bill&#8217;s lean hands clawed the reins with muscles of
steel. For the moment his six horses occupied his every
thought. They were pulling with the madness of high-bred
racehorses. The trail lay before them, their master sat behind.
What more could they want, but that liberty to
stretch their willing bodies?</p>
<p>Down the hill and along the wood-lined trail that ran
parallel to the sluggish creek they raced. The dust rose
under their feet, and the wheels of the cart left a fog behind
them. It rose in swirling clouds as though to shut off
all retreat. Presently the road narrowed to a mere track,
and the dark woods closed in. But there was no slackening
under the hand of the gambler. Nor had the horses any
desire to slacken their headlong rush. The woods broke
and gave to a low bush, and in a moment the track opened
upon Scipio&#8217;s claim.</p>
<p>Now, for the first time since the start as they swept across
it, Bill permitted his gaze to wander from his charges. He
looked away at the mouth of the tunnel Sandy had spent so
much labor and such bitter cursing in the process of constructing;
and a half-smile flitted across his hard face as he
beheld the oozy d&eacute;bris, the idle tools, the winch and buckets.
The sight seemed to afford him amusement. There was a
softening, too, in his hard face. Maybe it was the result of
his amusement. Maybe it was due to some thought of the
little man with whom he was partners. But he seemed to
freeze up again as the claim passed, and the horses floundered
over the heavy trail beside the black, oily swamp beyond.
It was bad driving here, and he steadied the racing
creatures down with voice and hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy, Gipsy. Easy you, Pete. Now Maisie. So!
Steady, boys. Easy!&#8221;</p>
<p>The harsh voice was hushed and gentle. He was speaking
to creatures that were not merely horses to him, but
something nearer, perhaps even dearer.</p>
<p>And the well-trained creatures responded at once, slowing
to an easy trot, a pace which they kept until the ford of the
creek was reached. Here they dropped to a walk as they
splashed their way through the turgid stream. But the
moment the wheels of the cart topped the opposite bank,
they once more resumed their headlong gait.</p>
<p>At once the gambler sat up. He straightened his lean body
as a man who opens his lungs to breathe in deep draughts of
fresh, bracing air. His narrow eyes stared out aside of him
and beyond. His nostrils expanded, and his thin lips were
tightly shut.</p>
<p>The camp was behind him. The trail, a hard, wide sand
trail, lay ahead. The wide, wild world was about him on
every hand, reminding him of days long gone by, reminding
him that to-day his instincts were still the same. The same
fiery, militant spirit that had driven him from one end of his
country to the other still left him yearning for the ruthless
battle of wild places and wilder men. The long months of
inactivity, the long days of peace, the longer nights of his
gambler&#8217;s craft, were for the moment gone. He was setting
out, as in the old days, surrounded by all in life he cared for,
offering a challenge to all the world, ready to grapple with
whatsoever the gods of war might choose to thrust in his
way.</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s spirits rose. The swift-flashing eyes brightened.
His body felt to be bursting with a ravishing joy of
life. His purpose was his own. The joy was his alone.
He had found excuse for satisfying his own greedy lust,
a lust for battle which no overwhelming odds could diminish.
He was a savage. He knew it; he gloried in it.
Peace to him was a wearisome burden of which at all times
he was ready to rid himself. So he was born. So he had
always lived. So, he knew, he would die.</p>
<p>The trail rose with the upland. It rose with that gradation
which so wears down the ardor of almost any horse.
But the creatures Wild Bill was driving were made of unusual
mettle. Their courage was the courage of the man
behind them. And only when his courage failed him would
their spirit falter. They swept up the long stretch as
though the effort were a pastime. With ears pricked forward,
nostrils gushing, their veins standing out like whipcord
through their satin coats, they moved as though every
stride were an expression of the joy of living. And the
man&#8217;s steel muscles were held at tension to keep their gait
within the bounds of reason.</p>
<p>As they neared the hill-top he turned and glanced back
over his shoulder. There lay the camp nestling on the far
side of the creek. There stood Minky&#8217;s store, lording it
over its lesser fellows with the arrogance of successful
commerce. He could see a small patch of figures standing
about its veranda, and he knew that many eyes were
watching for a final sight of him at the moment when he
should vanish over the hill.</p>
<p>They were friendly eyes, too, he knew. They were the
eyes of men who wished him well. But he doubted if those
good wishes were for his own sake. He knew he was not a
man whom men loved. And he smiled grimly as he glanced
down at the chest of gold in the body of the cart.</p>
<p>In a moment his eyes were looking out ahead again, and
all thought of those he was leaving behind left his mind.</p>
<p>The hill-top passed, the horses swung down into a deep,
long valley. It was in this valley, some six or seven miles
farther on, he had encountered Scipio in Minky&#8217;s buckboard.
He thought of that meeting now, and remembered
many things; and as recollection stirred his teeth shut tight
till his jaw muscles stood out like walnuts through his lean
cheeks. He had promised Scipio that day. Well, his mind
was easier than his feelings. He was confident. But he
was stirred to a nervous desire to be doing.</p>
<p>Nothing escaped his watchful eyes. Every tree, every
bush, every rise and hollow passed under his closest scrutiny.
But this was simply his way, a way that had long
since been forced into a habit. He did not anticipate any
developments yet. The battle-cry was yet to be sounded.
He knew the men he was likely to deal with better than any
other class. He knew their ways, their subtleties. Who
should know them better? Had not years of his life been
spent&ndash;&ndash;?</p>
<p>He laughed aloud, but his laughter rang without mirth.
And his horses, taking the sound to be a command, broke
suddenly into a gallop. It was the sympathy between man
and beast asserting itself. They, too, possessed that nervous
desire to be doing. Something of the significance of the
journey was theirs, and their nerves were braced with the
temper of fine steel.</p>
<p>He steadied them down with the patience of a devoted
father for a pack of boisterous children. No harsh words
disturbed their sensitive ears. The certainty of their obedience
made it unnecessary to exert any display of violence.
They promptly fell again into their racing trot, and the cart
once more ran smoothly over the hard beaten trail.</p>
<p>The higher reaches of the creek cut into the valley from
the right, and the trail deviated to a rise of sandy ground.
He had reached the point of his meeting with Scipio. Nor
did he slacken his pace over the dust-laden patch. It was
passed in a choking cloud, and in a moment the rise was
topped and a wild, broken country spread out before him.</p>
<p>Five miles farther on he halted beside a small mountain
stream and breathed his horses.</p>
<p>But his halt was of the briefest. He simply let the horses
stand in their harness. It was not time to feed, but he
removed their bits and let them nip up the bunches of sweet
grass about their feet. And as he did so he paused a moment
at the head of each animal, muttering words of encouragement,
and administering caresses with a hand which
bore in its touch an affection that no words of his could
have conveyed.</p>
<p>Then he went back to the cart and made a few simple
dispositions. One was to securely lash the gold-chest in its
place; but its place he changed to the front of the cart.
Another was to leave the lid of the foot-box, built against
the dashboard, wide open, and to so secure it that it could
not close again. Another was to adjust the lowered hood
of the cart in a certain way that it was raised head-high as
he sat in his driving-seat.</p>
<p>Then, with a grim satisfaction in his small eyes as he
glanced over his simple preparations, he jumped to the
ground and replaced the bits in his horses&#8217; mouths. In two
minutes he was again rushing over the trail, but this time
through a world of crag and forest as primitive and rugged
as was his own savage soul.</p>
<p>So the journey went on, over mountainous hills, and deep
down into valleys as dark as only mountain forests of
spruce and pine could make them. Over a broken road
that set the light cart perilously bumping, speeding along the
edges of precipices, with little more than inches to spare, at
a pace that might well set the nerves jangling with every
jolt. Later a halt for feed and water, and on again, the
willing horses taking their rest only as the difficulties of the
trail reduced their pace to a laborious walk.</p>
<p>The man sat alert through it all. There was no question
in his mind. He knew what lay ahead of him somewhere in
those vast depths. He knew that what he looked for was
coming just as surely as the Day of Doom. He did not ask
when or where. That was not his way. It might come
when it chose, for his part. He was ready and even yearning
for the moment of its coming.</p>
<p>So his eyes never rested for a moment. Scarce a glance
or thought did he give to his horses. Theirs it was to keep
to the trail. Theirs it was to keep their pace. His was all
other responsibility.</p>
<p>The sun was leaning towards the western crags, where, in
the distance, they raised their snow-crowned heads towards
the heavens. The ruddy daylight was deepening to that
warmth of color which belongs to day&#8217;s old age. The forest
shadows appeared to deepen, those dark forests so far below
him in the valleys. Here, where he was racing along at a
high level, all was bright, the air was joyous. Below him
lay the brooding stillness where lurked a hundred unknown
dangers. There were only about fifteen more miles of this
broken solitude, and beyond that stretched a world of waving,
gracious grassland right on to the prairie city whither
he was bound.</p>
<p>He stirred; his roving eyes abruptly concentrated. One
distant spot on the rugged landscape held him. He craned
forward. The movement caused him to ease his hand upon
the reins. Instantly the horses sprang into a gallop. So
intent was he that for the moment the change passed unnoticed.
He seemed only to have eyes and thought for that
distant hill-top. Then of a sudden he realized the dangerous
breakneck speed, and turned his attention upon his
team.</p>
<p>The animals once more reduced to a sober pace, he turned
again to the spot which held his interest; and his eyes grew
bright with a smile that had nothing pleasant in it. He was
grinning with a savage joy more fierce, more threatening,
than the cruellest frown. The next time he bestirred himself
it was to swing his gun-holsters more handy to the
front of his body.</p>
<p>Later on his interest seemed to lessen. No longer was
there that watchfulness in his eyes. Perhaps it was he
deemed there was no longer the necessity for it. Perhaps
what he had seen had satisfied his restless searching. Anyway,
he now sat contemplating the shining backs of his
horses as they sped down the hill, and his eyes were friendly
as he watched the rolls of muscle writhing under their satin
coats.</p>
<p>But when next he looked up his moment of gentleness had
passed. His easier moods were never of long duration.
One swift glance again at the distant hill, and then he
turned from it and sat gazing at the dank, oozy prospect of
the low-lying flat he was just entering with no sort of
friendliness. The sharp hoofs of his team were flinging
mud in every direction, and the rattle of the wheels had
deadened to a thick sucking as they sank into the black
mud. It was a heavy pull, but the speed was not checked.
It only needed an extra effort, and this the willing team
readily applied. He knew the spot well; and he knew that
beyond lay the hill, the crest of which had so held his attention
a few minutes before.</p>
<p>His thoughts traveled no farther than that hill. For the
time at least there was nothing beyond. Later it would be
for him to consider that. Just ahead of him lay the chances
and changes which went to make up such a life as his.
This he knew. And somehow the thought stimulated his
pulses to a fuller appreciation of things.</p>
<p>In a few moments he was nearing the far boundary of the
flat, and the ascent of the hill was about to commence. He
smiled. Yes, it was well calculated. The hill would have
to be taken at a walk. It was by far the steepest of the
journey. He remembered, too, that the crest of it was
reached by a final climb that became almost precipitous.
He remembered, too, that the black woods that crowded its
sides at the crest gave place to the skeleton trunks left by
some long-forgotten forest fire. Yes, it was the one spot on
the whole journey best calculated for what was to come.</p>
<p>The team no longer labored in the ooze. The ascent was
begun. With heads held high, with ears pricked and nostrils
distended they faced the big effort unflinchingly.</p>
<p>And the driver&#8217;s mind was calculating many things. It
was moving with the swiftness of an able general&#8217;s in the
midst of a big action. He glanced at the sky. Already the
sun was hidden behind the western hills. Already the shadows
were lengthening and the gray of evening was falling.
The profound woods, dense and ghostly, had closed in.
The trail was so narrow that the dreary, weeping foliage
often swept the sides of the cart. But these things did not
occur to him. His mind was ahead, amongst those aged
skeletons left by the raging fire-fiend.</p>
<p>Progress was slow. It was almost too slow for the man&#8217;s
eager nerves. He wanted to reach his goal. His lean body
thrilled with a profound joy. He lusted for the battle
which he knew to lie ahead of him. But, even so, he gave
no outward sign. His face was set and harsh. His small
eyes bored through the gloom, thrusting to penetrate beyond
every bend in the winding road. Nothing escaped them.
Each small fur that fled in terror at his approach was carefully
noted, for they told him things he wanted to know.</p>
<p>Now the final steep was reached. It was truly precipitous.
The sharp hoofs of the team clawed their way up.
Such was the struggle that even the man found himself
leaning forward, instinctively desiring to help the laboring
animals. The bends in the trail were sudden and at brief
intervals. It was as though those responsible for the original
clearing of the road had realized the impossibility of a
direct ascent, and had chosen the zigzag path as the only
means of surmounting the hill.</p>
<p>The moments passed. Bend followed bend. The man in
the cart found himself mechanically counting them. Two
more. One more. The summit was almost reached. And
beyond? He sighed. Maybe it was the sigh of a man
whose nerves are relieved from their tension, knowing that
beyond this last bend lay his goal. Maybe it was inspired
by sympathy for his struggling horses. Anyway, his
whole manner underwent a change. The watchfulness
seemed to have gone from his eyes, his muscles to have relaxed.
He leant back in his seat like a man full of weariness,
and securely fastened his reins to an iron rail on
the side of the cart.</p>
<p>He was at the bend now. The leaders were abreast of it.
They were past it. He&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>There was a sharp rattle of firearms, and half-a-dozen
bullets swept pinging their way over his head. A hoarse
voice shouted a command to halt. His horses plunged forward.
But, quick as lightning, his hands flew to the reins,
and he drew them up to a standstill in the open.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hands up!&#8221; shouted the same voice; and a horseman
appeared on each side of the team.</p>
<p>Then came an exhibition of the gambler as he was, as in
the old days he had always been known. It was all done in
the fraction of a second. Simultaneously his two guns
leapt from his holsters and two shots rang out. There was
an ominous echo from the woods. One horseman reeled in
his saddle, and the horse of the other man stumbled and
finally fell.</p>
<p>The next moment the man in the cart was crouching
down, all but the crown of his head and his gleaming eyes
well sheltered by the loose-hanging canvas hood.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m &#8217;most allus ready to put my hands up!&#8221; he snarled.
&#8220;Come on!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>THE BATTLE</h3>
</div>
<p>A shout of fury. A wild chorus of meaningless blasphemy.
A thundering of hoofs. A shriek of pain&ndash;&ndash;an
appalling death-cry. The fight has begun&ndash;&ndash;such a fight, in
its wanton savagery, as might shame even the forest beasts.
In a moment the human lusting for the blood of its fellows
is let loose, than which there is no more terrible madness on
earth.</p>
<p>Yet there was a difference. There was a difference of
motive widely separating the combatants; and it was a difference
that left the balance of offense doubtful.</p>
<p>To analyze the mental attitude of these people adequately
would be well-nigh impossible. Their outlook possessed
distortions which changed with chameleon-like rapidity.
On the one hand was a band of lawless ruffians, steeped to
their very souls in every sort of crime, in whose minds all
law was anathema, in whose understanding all possession
was a deliberate challenge, in whose hearts was no pity,
no mercy, no feeling which belongs to the gentler side of
human life; to whose comprehension death has no meaning
until its relentless grip is fixed, and they feel the last spark
of life crushing out of their own bodies. Then&ndash;&ndash;But the
analysis becomes hopelessly chaotic.</p>
<p>On the other hand motive is perhaps even more difficult
still, though a shade less hopeless. The gambler was a man
of strong thought, of strong forces. Nor was he devoid of
the gentler feelings of life. Yet here lies the difficulty of
associating the various sides of his character with his actions.
He had set out for this encounter. He had yearned
for it, as a child might yearn for a plaything. The contemplation
of it gave him ecstasy. With an inhuman joy he
desired the lives of these men. Not one, but all; and one
even more than all. Then, too, his purpose was in face of
overwhelming odds&ndash;&ndash;in face of almost a certainty of death
for himself. Such actions have been performed before in
noble cases, but here&ndash;&ndash;?</p>
<p>Was it simply his purpose to yield himself a martyr to the
public welfare? Was it that he truly desired to avenge a
wronged man? Was he setting himself up as the avenger
of Sid Morton&#8217;s cruel death, a man in whom he had no
interest whatever? No. It would be absurd to believe that
these things were the promptings responsible for his present
actions. Some hideous psychological twist was driving him.
Some passion swayed him over which he had no control
whatever. Some degeneracy was upsetting his mental balance,
and forcing him against his better instincts. But,
even so, his whole attitude was that of a man of clear, alert
mind, of iron purpose, of a courage invincible.</p>
<p>Calm and cold Wild Bill crouched while, in the first rush
of battle, the shots hailed about him. He reserved his fire,
too, waiting for the effective moment with the patience of
a skillful general. His every shot must tell, and tell desperately.</p>
<p>Three times he was hit in as many seconds, but beyond
hugging his flimsy shelter more closely he gave no sign.
His purpose rose above all physical hurt or sense of pain.
He was watching the movements of one man&ndash;&ndash;of one man
only. His gleaming eyes pursued the figure of the outlaw
leader to the exclusion of all else. James was his quarry.
The rest&ndash;&ndash;well, the rest were merely incidental.</p>
<p>And, emboldened by his intended victim&#8217;s silence, James
suddenly changed his tactics. A long-ranged battle was little
enough to his savage taste. He ceased the ineffective
fire of his men and brought them together. Then in a moment,
with the reckless abandon of his class, he headed
them and charged. They came, as before, with a brazen
shout, and the air was hideous with a fresh outburst of blasphemy,
while a rush of lead searched the fragile cart in
every direction.</p>
<p>But the din of voices, the crash of woodwork as the
panels of the cart were riddled by the wildly flung shots,
was powerless to draw the defender. His guns were
ready. He was ready for the purpose in his mind. That
was all. His fierce eyes lit with a murderous intent as he
calculated with certainty and exactness.</p>
<p>On they came. They drove their maddened horses with
savage spurs right up to the cart. It was the moment the
gambler awaited. He leapt, and in a flash his tall figure
was confronting the leader of the attack. And as he rose
his arms were outstretched and his great guns belched their
murderous fire. Two men rolled from their saddles with a
death-scream that died down to a hideous gurgle, as the racing
hoofs trod the last atom of life out of their bodies. His
guns belched a second time, and James&#8217; throat was plowed
open, and the rich red blood spurted in a ghastly tide. Another
shot and another man fell forward, clutching his
horse&#8217;s mane while he was borne from the battle-field to the
dim recesses of the forest by his uncontrolled and affrighted
beast.</p>
<p>But the gambler paid a high price for these successes&ndash;&ndash;far
higher than he could really afford. Four times more he
was badly hit. Four times the hot slither of burning lead
plowed its way amidst the life-channels of his body.
And his retreat to cover was something almost in the nature
of collapse.</p>
<p>But the spirit of the man admitted of no weakening. It
rose dominant over all physical sensation. He thrust aside
the cognizance of his hurts, and abandoned himself solely to
his purpose. James was still in the saddle, and the sight of
his hated personality consumed him with rage and disgust at
the failure of his first attempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still around. Still around,&#8221; he muttered. And in a
moment the battle was surging once more.</p>
<p>No longer was the leader of the attack moved by the irresponsible
bravado of his first attack. He was a raging
savage, goaded by the desperate wounds he had received, and
the knowledge that he and all his force were being held at
bay by one man. So he charged again, a headlong rush,
howling as he came at the head of his four remaining supporters.</p>
<p>They came like an avalanche, their voices making hideous
the rapidly falling night, while the wounded defender
waited, waited, all his purpose concentrated, husbanding his
ebbing strength as a starving man might husband the last
crumbs of food. He knew that not only his strength, but
his very life was slowly ebbing in the red tide that was fast
saturating every shred of his clothing.</p>
<p>Again they reached the cart. Again the maddened horses
were driven head on to the dreaded fortress. And instantly
their quarry rose to his full height, a grim specter
thrilling with a murderous purpose, his arms outstretched,
his guns held low, that there should be no mistake this time.</p>
<p>The crash of battle was appalling. The scene was almost
lost in the smoke cloud which hung over it. There was fire
and cross-fire. There were exultant shouts and cries of
pain. And through it all the scuttling of rushing hoofs and
champing bits. A moment and the defender dropped. But
instantly he rose again, gripping in his nervous hands the
butts of a pair of fresh guns snatched from his foot-box.
Nor did he stir foot again, nor relax a muscle, till every
one of the twelve chambers was emptied.</p>
<p>Then, with an oath that carried with it all the pent-up
hatred of a bitter heart, he flung both weapons in the direction
whither his last shot had gone, and, staggering back,
dropped helplessly into the driving-seat behind him.</p>
<p>The smoke hung heavily and drifted slowly away upon
the still air. The sound of rushing hoofs receded and died
away in the distance, and in a while a profound quiet
settled upon the scene. The man lolled heavily in his seat,
and his eyes closed. His face was a ghastly gray, his eyes
were sunken and his blackened lips hung agape. His arms
hung helplessly at his side, and his legs were stretched out
in a pitiable attitude of uselessness.</p>
<p>The moments passed drearily. For a long time there was
no movement of any sort but the restless fidgeting of the
horses. They had stood through all the turmoil as their
master had long since trained them to stand. But now that
it was over their eager spirits were demanding the joy of the
trail again. It almost seemed as though, in their equine
minds, they had a full realization of the meaning of that
battle in the wild, as though sympathy between master and
beast had held them during that fierce ten minutes still and
passive, lest through any act of theirs they should cross the
will of the one being whom they acknowledged their lord.
And now that it was over and the crisis passed, it seemed as
if they understood that victory had been achieved, and their
duty once more lay upon the trail ahead of them.</p>
<p>At last the eyes of the man opened. The chafing of his
horses had penetrated to his numbing brain. Their fierce
depths were dull and lusterless as they rolled vaguely
around. Yet there was intelligence in them, although it was
the intelligence of a weary, fainting mind. They closed
again, as though the will behind them lacked in its support.
And then followed a sigh, a deep, long sigh of exhaustion.</p>
<p>There was another pause, and presently there came a
bodily movement. The man stirred uneasily, in the manner
of one gathering his weakening forces for a supreme effort
from which his whole body shrank. Again his eyes opened,
and this time their depths were full of purpose. Suddenly
his legs gathered under him and his arms drew up, and in a
moment he staggered to his feet, his hands clutching support
upon the back of the seat.</p>
<p>He stared about him doubtfully, and his uncertainty was
pitiful to behold. His eyes were only half open, as though
the effort of sustaining their lids was too great for his failing
powers. They wandered on over the scene, however,
until they suddenly fixed themselves upon a spot where two
figures were stretched upon the ground. One was lying
upon its side with its knees drawn up as though asleep; the
other was stretched upon its back, its arms flung out and its
legs lying across the other&#8217;s body. The dead eyes were
staring up at the darkened sky, glazed and motionless.</p>
<p>He stared down upon these figures for some time, and the
sight seemed to put fresh strength into him; and at last,
when he turned away, a pitiful attempt at triumph shone in
his dull eyes, and a ghostly smile flitted about the corners
of his sagging lips.</p>
<p>He had seen all he wanted to see. His work was done.
James was dead. He knew death when he saw it, and he
had seen it shining in those staring eyes. James had passed
over the one-way trail, and his had been the hand that had
sped him upon his journey.</p>
<p>Now he took a deep breath and stood swaying. Then he
glanced with measuring eye at the foot-box at his feet. He
changed his support, and, bending slowly, dragged a rawhide
rope from inside it. The next moment he fell back upon
the seat. But his work had only begun. For some time he
fumbled with the rope, passing it about his body and the
iron stanchions of the back of the seat, and after awhile had
succeeded in knotting it securely. Then, after a moment
of hard breathing, he reached out and untied the reins from
the rail of the cart and gathered them into his hands. And
as he did so his lips moved and his voice croaked brokenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Gyp,&#8221; he mumbled hoarsely. &#8220;Come, gal.
Hey&ndash;&ndash;you, Pete. You, too&ndash;&ndash;Maisie. Come on. Get on.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the word his faithful friends had awaited.</p>
<p>Chilled and eager, they leapt at their bits, and the traces
snapped taut. They were off; and in their eager rush the
reins were almost torn from the driver&#8217;s numbing fingers.
Again he spoke, and in his halting words was a world of affection
and encouragement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy, children,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Easy, boys an&#8217; gals. Ther&#8217;
sure ain&#8217;t no hurry now. They&#8217;re dead&ndash;&ndash;all&ndash;&ndash;dead.
Dead as&ndash;&ndash;mutton.&#8221;</p>
<p>He clawed full possession of the reins again. And in a
moment the cart was speeding down the long gradient that
was to bear them on the prairie world beyond.</p>
<p>The man was lolling forward, straining on the rope that
held his helpless body to the seat, and his eyes closed
wearily. The speed of the team, the direction, these things
meant nothing to him now. The trail was well marked
right in to Spawn City. There were no turnings. That
was all that mattered. These children of his would faithfully
keep on their way to the end. He knew these things
without thinking, and the knowledge left him indifferent.
His only concern now was the gold. It was in the cart, and
it must reach Spawn City. To that his honor was pledged.</p>
<p>The reins slipped through his fingers. He stirred uneasily.
Then his eyes opened again. For a moment his
sagging lips closed. He was summoning all his failing
strength. He clutched the reins in one hand, and with the
other knotted them about his wrist. Then, with a gasp, his
left hand dropped from his task, while his right arm was
held outstretched by the strain of the pulling horses upon
the reins.</p>
<p>There was now no longer any demand for further effort,
and the drooping body lolled over against the side of the
cart as though the man were seeking his rest. His head
hung away at a helpless angle, and his legs straggled. And
thus the speeding team raced clear of the mountain world
and plunged through the darkness to the prairie beyond.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The moon rose in all its cold splendor. The stars dimmed
before its frigid smile. The black vault of the heavens lit
with a silvery sheen, embracing the prairie world beneath its
bejeweled pall.</p>
<p>The sea of grass lay shadowed in the moonlit dusk. But,
in sharp relief, a white ribbon-like trail split it from end to
end, like some forlorn creature with white outspread arms
yearning in desolation&ndash;&ndash;yearning for the bustle and rush of
busy life which it is denied, yearning to be relieved from so
desperate a solitude.</p>
<p>The vastness and silence dwarfs even thought. The
things which are great, which have significance, which have
meaning to the human mind are lost in such a world. Life
itself becomes infinitesimal.</p>
<p>There is something moving in a tiny ebullition of dust
along the white trail. It looks so small. It moves so
slowly, crawling, seemingly, at a snail&#8217;s pace. It is almost
microscopical in the vastness.</p>
<p>Yet it is only these things by comparison. It is neither
small, nor is it traveling at a snail&#8217;s pace. It is a cart drawn
by six horses, racing as though pursued by all the demons of
the nether world.</p>
<p>And in the driving-seat is a curious, stiffly swaying figure.
It is strangely inanimate. Yet it suggests something that no
ordinary human figure could suggest. It is in its huddled
attitude, its ghastly face, its staring, unseeing eyes, which
gaze out in every direction, as the jolting of the cart turns
and twists the body from side to side. There is something
colossal, something strangely stirring in the suggestion of
purpose in the figure. There is something to inspire wonder
in the most sluggish mind. It tells a story of some sort
of heroism. It tells a story of a master mind triumphing
over bodily weakness and suffering. It tells a story of
superlative defiance&ndash;&ndash;the defiance of death.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The early risers of Spawn City were gathered in a stupefied
crowd outside the principal hotel in the place. Six
jaded horses, drawing a light spring-cart, had just pulled up.
The poor creatures were utterly spent, and stood with
drooping heads and distended nostrils, gasping and steaming,
their weary legs tottering beneath them. Their great
eyes were yearning and sunken, and their small ears lay
back, indifferent to every sound or movement about them.
Their last buoyancy has been expended. They have run
their mad race till their hearts are nigh bursting.</p>
<p>But the horses were of the least interest to the onlookers.
It was the dusty spring-cart that interested their curious
minds&ndash;&ndash;the cart, and the still and silent driver, who made
no attempt to leave his seat. They stood gaping, not daring
to disturb the ghastly figure, not daring even to approach it
too closely. Their minds were thrilling with a morbid
horror which held them silent.</p>
<p>But at last there came a diversion. A burly, rough-clad
man pushed his way through the crowd, and his keen eyes
flashed a quick look over the whole outfit. He was the
sheriff, and had been hurriedly summoned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wild Bill!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Them&#8217;s sure his plugs,
too,&#8221; he added, as though seeking corroboration.</p>
<p>There was certainly doubt in his tone, and surprise, too;
and he came to the side of the cart and gazed up into the
awful face drooping forward over the outstretched arm to
further convince himself. What he beheld caused him to
click his tongue against the roof of his mouth. It was his
only means of giving expression to the wave of horror that
swept over him.</p>
<p>With a leap he sprang into the seat, and began releasing
the knotted reins from the stiffened arm. So tight had the
knots been drawn that it took some moments. Then he
turned, and with difficulty removed the rawhide from about
the middle of the huddled figure. Then he hailed some of
the onlookers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho, you, Joe! You, too, Lalor, an&#8217; Ned! Stand by,
lads, an&#8217; bear a hand,&#8221; he cried authoritatively. &#8220;Guess
I&#8217;ll pass it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he stood up, staring down at the stiffened body; and
wonder looked out of his puzzled eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! if it ain&#8217;t Wild Bill the gambler, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; he must
ha&#8217; bin dead nigh six hours.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h3>A MAN&#8217;S LOVE</h3>
</div>
<p>It was with strangely mixed feelings that Scipio drove
Minky&#8217;s old mule down the shelving trail leading into the
secret valley where stood James&#8217; ranch-house. The recollection
of his first visit to the place was a sort of nightmare
which clung desperately in the back cells of memory. The
dreadful incidents leading up to it and surrounding it could
never be forgotten. Every detail of his headlong journey in
quest of the man who had wronged him, every detail of his
terrible discomfiture, would cling in his memory so long
as he had life.</p>
<p>But, in spite of memory, in spite of his wrongs, his heart-burnings,
the desolation of the past weeks, his heart rose
buoyantly as he came within sight of the place in which he
still persisted in telling himself that his Jessie was held a
prisoner against her will. That was his nature. No
optimism was too big for him. No trouble was so great
that hope could altogether be crushed out of his heart.</p>
<p>He looked out over the splendid valley extending for
miles on either hand of him, and somehow he was glad.
Somehow the glorious sunlight, so softened by the shadowed
forest which covered the hillsides, so gentle beneath the
crowding hills which troughed in the bed of waving grass,
sent his simple spirit soaring to heights of anticipatory delight
which, a few days back, had seemed beyond his reach.</p>
<p>At that moment, in spite of all that had gone before, the
place was very, very beautiful to him, life was wonderful,
his very existence was a joy. For was not Jessie waiting
for him beyond, in that ranch-house? Was not she waiting
for his coming, that she might return with him to their
home? Was she not presently to be seated beside him upon
the rickety old seat of Minky&#8217;s buckboard? And his final
thought caused him to glance regretfully down at the frayed
cushion, wishing cordially that he could have afforded her
greater comfort.</p>
<p>Ah, well, perhaps she would not mind just for this once.
And, after all, she would be with him, which was the great
thing. Wild Bill had promised him that; and he had every
confidence in Wild Bill.</p>
<p>Then he suddenly thought of something he might have
done. Surely he might have brought Vada with him.
What a pity he didn&#8217;t think of it before he started out. It
was foolish of him, very foolish. But he had been so full
of Jessie. The thought of winning her back had quite put
everything else out of his head. Yes, it was a pity. The
presence of Vada would certainly have added to her happiness,
she was so fond of her children.</p>
<p>Then he remembered his instructions. Bill had said he
must go alone. He must go alone&ndash;&ndash;and be prepared to
fight for her. Bill was a wonderful man. He seemed to
be able to do anything he chose. And somehow he felt
sorry he had bluffed him into buying half his claim. He
could feel the roll of bills, the result of that transaction, in
his hip pocket, and the pressure of them impressed itself unpleasantly
upon his conscience. He felt sure he had no right
to them. He must really give them back to the gambler later.
He felt that his attitude was a swindle on a good man.
Bill was certainly a good man, a brave man, but he was no
business man. He, Scipio, had the advantage of him there.</p>
<p>The buckboard rumbled down to the grassy trail which
stretched from the foot of the hillside to the ranch-house.
And now the pale-eyed little man bethought him of the fight
Bill had promised him.</p>
<p>Quite unperturbed he looked down at the fierce pair of
revolvers hanging at his waist. He was taking no chances
this time. He had borrowed these guns from Minky, the
same as he had borrowed the mule and buckboard. They
were fine weapons, too. He had tried them. Oh, no, if it
came to shooting he would give a different account of himself
this time. Mr. James must look to himself. So must
Abe Conroy. He would have no mercy. And he frowned
darkly down at the gigantic weapons.</p>
<p>Now he considered carefully the buildings ahead. The
ranch was certainly a fine place. He found it in his heart
to admire it, and only felt pity that it was the house of such
a pitiable scoundrel as James. And yet he really felt sorry
for James. Perhaps, after all, he ought not to be too hard
on the man. Of course, he was a wicked scoundrel, but
that might be merely misfortune. And, anyway, Jessie, his
Jessie, was a very beautiful woman.</p>
<p>His eyes wandered on to the distant hills, catching up the
smaller details of interest as they traveled. There were
hundreds of cattle grazing about, and horses, too. Then
there were the fenced-in pastures and the branding corrals.
James must certainly be an excellent rancher, even if he
were a scoundrel.</p>
<p>But the place was very still. Strangely still, he thought.
There was not even one of the usual camp dogs to offer him
its hostile welcome. He could see none of the &#8220;hands&#8221;
moving about. Perhaps they were&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Of course. For the moment he had forgotten that they
were not simple ranchers. He had forgotten they were
man-hunters. They were probably out on the trail pursuing
their nefarious calling. And, of course, Bill knew it.
That was why he had told him to drive out on this particular
morning. Wonderful man, Bill!</p>
<p>Suddenly the distant neighing of a horse startled him, and
he looked across the woods beyond the house, the direction,
he calculated, whence the sound came. But there was no
horse to be seen. Nothing except the darkling cover of pine
woods. It was strange. He was sure the sound came from
that direction. No; there was certainly nothing in the
shape of a horse out there. There wasn&#8217;t even a cow.
Perhaps it was a &#8220;stray&#8221; amongst the trees. So he dismissed
the matter from his mind and chirruped at the old
mule.</p>
<p>And now he came up to the ranch; and the stillness of
the place became even more pronounced. It really was
astonishing. Surely there must be somebody about. He
pushed his guns well to the front, and drew his prairie hat
forward so that the brim shaded his pale eyes. He further
shifted his reins into his left hand, and sat with his right on
the butt of one of his weapons. Whatever was to come he
was ready for it. One thing he had made up his mind to;
he would stand no nonsense from anybody&ndash;&ndash;certainly not
from James or Conroy.</p>
<p>The old mule plodded on, and, with the instinct of its
kind, headed in the direction of the nearest corral. And
Scipio was forced to abandon his warlike attitude, and with
both hands drag him away into the direction of the house
door. But somehow in those last moments he entirely forgot
that his mission was a fighting one, and sat shaking the
reins and chirruping noisily in the approved manner of any
farmer on a visit.</p>
<p>He stared up at the house as he came. His eyes were
filled with longing. He forgot the barns, the corrals as possible
ambushes. He forgot every thought of offense or defense.
There was the abode of his beloved Jessie, and all
he wondered was in which part of it lay her prison. He
was overflowing with a love so great that there was no
room in either brain or body for any other thought or feeling.</p>
<p>But Jessie was nowhere to be seen, and a shadow of disappointment
clouded his face as he halted the only too willing
beast and clambered down between the spidery wheels.
Nor did he wait to secure his faithful servitor, or to think
of anything practical at all. He hustled up to the open
doorway, and, pushing his head in through it, called till
the echoes of the place rang&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho, Jess! Ho, you, Jess! It&#8217;s me&ndash;&ndash;Zip! I come to
fetch you to home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The echoes died away and the place became still again.
And somehow the quiet of it set him bristling. His hands
flew to his guns and remained there while he stood listening.
But no answer came, and his redundant hope slowly ebbed,
leaving a muddy shore of apprehension.</p>
<p>Then, with one glance back over his shoulder, he moved
into the building with much the stealth of a thief. In the
living-room he stood and stared about him uncertainly. It
was the same room he had been in before, and he remembered
its every detail. Suddenly he pushed the evil of those
recollections aside and called again&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho, Jess! Ho-o-o!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the confidence had gone from his tone, and his call
suggested an underlying doubt.</p>
<p>Again came the echoes. Again they died. Then&ndash;&ndash;yes&ndash;&ndash;there
was a sound that had nothing to do with echoes.
Again&ndash;&ndash;yes&ndash;&ndash;sure. It was the sound of someone moving
in an upper room. He listened attentively, and again his
eyes brightened with ready hope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jess! Jess!&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>And this time there was an answer.</p>
<p>Without a moment&#8217;s hesitation, without a second&#8217;s
thought, he dashed through an open doorway and ran up the
narrow flight of stairs beyond.</p>
<p>At last, at last! His Jessie! He had heard her voice.
He had heard the music he had longed for, craved for,
prayed for. Was there anything in the world that mattered
else? Was there anything in the world that could keep
him from her now? No, not now. His love permeated
his whole being. There was no thought in his mind of
what she had done. There was no room in his simple heart
for anything but the love he could not help, and would not
have helped if he could. There was no obstacle now, be
it mountain or stream, that he could not bridge to reach his
Jessie. His love was his life, and his life belonged to&ndash;&ndash;Jessie.</p>
<p>He reached the top of the stairs, and a door stood open
before him. He did not pause to consider what lay beyond.
His instinct guided him. His love led him whither
it would, and it led him straight into the presence he
desired more than all the world. It led him straight to
Jessie.</p>
<p>For the fraction of a second he became aware of a vision
of womanhood, to him the most perfect in all the world.
He saw the well-loved face, now pale and drawn with suffering
and remorse. He saw the shadowed eyes full of an
affrighted, hunted expression. And, with a cry that bore in
its depth all the love of a heart as big as his small body, he
ran forward to clasp her in his arms.</p>
<p>But Jessie&#8217;s voice arrested him half-way. It thrilled with
hysterical denial, with suffering, regret, horror. And so
commanding was it that he had no power to defy its mandate.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she shrilled. &#8220;Keep back&ndash;&ndash;back. You
must not come near me. I am not fit for you to touch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not fit&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scipio stared helplessly at her, his eyes settling uncertainly
upon her hands as though he expected to find upon
them signs of some work she might have been engaged
upon&ndash;&ndash;some work that left her, as she had said, unfit to
touch. His comprehension was never quick. His imagination
was his weakest point.</p>
<p>Then his eyes came to her well-loved face again, and he
shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&ndash;&ndash;you got me beat, Jess. I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Zip, Zip!&#8221; Suddenly Jessie&#8217;s hands went up to
her face and her eyes were hidden. It was the movement
of one who fears to witness the hatred, the loathing, the
scorn which her own accusing mind assures her she merits.
It was the movement of one whose heart was torn by remorse
and shame, whose eyes were open to her sins, and
who realizes that earthly damnation is her future lot. Her
bosom heaved, and dry sobs choked her. And the little
man, who had come so far to claim her, stood perplexed and
troubled.</p>
<p>At last he struggled out a few words, longing to console,
but scarcely understanding how to go about it. All he
understood was that she was ill and suffering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Jess, you mustn&#8217;t to cry,&#8221; he said wistfully.
&#8220;Ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; to set you cryin&#8217;. Ther&#8217; sure ain&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But a woman&#8217;s hysteria was a thing unknown to him, and
his gentle attempt was swept aside in a torrent of insensate
denial.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! Don&#8217;t come near me,&#8221; she cried in a harsh,
strident tone. &#8220;Leave me. Leave me to my misery.
Don&#8217;t dare to come here mocking me. Don&#8217;t dare to accuse
me. Who are you to accuse? You are no better than
me. You have no right to come here as my judge. You,
with your smooth ways, your quiet sneers. Don&#8217;t you dare!
Don&#8217;t you dare! I&#8217;m no longer your wife, so you have no
right. I&#8217;m his&ndash;&ndash;his. Do you understand? I&#8217;m his. I
shall live the life I choose, and you shall not molest me.
I know you. You&#8217;ve come to accuse me, to tell me all I
am, to tax me with my shame. It&#8217;s cruel&ndash;&ndash;cruel. Oh,
God, help me&ndash;&ndash;help me!&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s voice died out in a piteous wail that smote
straight to the heart of the little man who stood shaking
before her hysterical outbreak. He knew not what to do.
His love prompted him to go to her and crush her to his
simple, loving heart, but somehow he found himself unable
to do anything but gaze with longing eyes upon the heart-broken
figure, as she leant upon the foot-rail of the bed.</p>
<p>He stirred. And in the moments that passed while his
eyes were fixed upon her rich, heaving bosom, his mind
groping vaguely, he became aware of everything about him.
He knew he was in her bedroom. He knew that the furnishings
were good. He knew that the sunlight was pouring
in through the open window, and that a broad band of
dazzling light was shining upon her lustrous dark hair. He
knew all these things in the same way that he knew she was
suffering so that she came near breaking his own sympathetic
heart.</p>
<p>But though his intellect failed him, and he had no idea of
what he ought to say or do, words came at last and tumbled
headlong from his lips, just as they were inspired, all unconsidered,
by his heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Jessie gal,&#8221; he cried in a softly persuasive tone,
&#8220;won&#8217;t you come to home&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; help me out?
Won&#8217;t you, gal?&#8221;</p>
<p>But he was given no time to complete his appeal. The
woman suddenly raised her face, and once more broke out in
hysterical fury.</p>
<p>&#8220;Home? Home? With you?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Ha, ha!
That&#8217;s too good! Home, with you to forever remind me
what I am? For you to sneer at me, and point me to your
friends for what I am? Never, never! Go you back where
you came from. I&#8217;m not a wife. Do you hear? God help
me, I&#8217;m&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; And she buried her face again upon her arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come to home, gal?&#8221; the man persisted.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you? I&#8217;m so desp&#8217;rit lonesome. An&#8217; the kids, too.
Gee! they&#8217;re jest yearnin&#8217; an&#8217; yearnin&#8217; for you&ndash;&ndash;nigh as bad
as me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took a step towards her with his arms outstretched.
All his soul was in his mild eyes. And presently Jessie
raised her head again. She stood staring at the wall opposite
her. It was as though she dared not face him. Her eyes
were burning, but they were less wild, and a sudden hope
thrilled the man&#8217;s heart. He hurried on, fearful lest the old
storm should break out again&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y&#8217;see, Jess, ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t nuthin&#8217; to our pore little shack
on the &#8216;dumps&#8217; without you. Ther&#8217; sure ain&#8217;t. Then ther&#8217;s
my claim. I sold ha&#8217;f. An&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I got money now&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s eyes turned slowly upon him. They were
red with unshed tears. Their expression was curious.
There was doubt and shrinking in them. It almost seemed
as if she were wondering if all the past days of regret and
longing had turned her brain, and she were listening to words
conjured by a distorted fancy, some insane delusion. She
could not believe. But Scipio continued, and his voice was
real enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;know I ain&#8217;t much of a feller for the likes of you,
Jess,&#8221; he said earnestly. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t quick. I ain&#8217;t jest bright.
But I do love you, my dear. I love you so I can&#8217;t think
nothin&#8217; else. I want you to home, Jess, that bad, I thank
God ev&#8217;ry day He give you to me. I want you so bad it
don&#8217;t seem you ever bin away from me. I want you that bad
I can&#8217;t remember the last week or so. You&#8217;ll come&ndash;&ndash;to
home, gal&ndash;&ndash;now? Think&ndash;&ndash;jest think o&#8217; them bits o&#8217; twins.
You wait till you see &#8217;em laff when they get eyes on you.
Say, they&#8217;re that bonny an&#8217; bright. They&#8217;re jest like you,
wi&#8217; their eyes all a-sparklin&#8217;, an&#8217; their cheeks that rosy.
Gee! they&#8217;re jest a-yearnin&#8217; an&#8217; a-callin&#8217; fer their mam&ndash;&ndash;same
as me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little man had moved another step nearer. His arms
were still outstretched, and his quaint face was all aglow
with the warmth and love that stirred him. Somewhere in
the back of his dull head he knew that he was pleading for
something more than his life. He had no subtlety in his
manner or his words. It was just his heart talking for him
and guiding him.</p>
<p>And in the woman had risen a sudden hope. It was a
struggling ray of light in the blackness of her despair. It
was a weak struggling flicker&ndash;&ndash;just a flicker. And even as
it rose its power was dashed again in the profundity of her
suffering. She could not grasp the hand held out&ndash;&ndash;she could
not see it. She could not believe the words her ears heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, don&#8217;t mock at me,&#8221; she cried, with a sudden
return to her old wildness. &#8220;It is cruel, cruel! Leave me.
For pity&#8217;s sake go. How can you stand there taunting me
so? How can I go with you? How can I face my children
now? Do you know what I am? No, no, of course you
don&#8217;t. You could never understand. You, with your foolish,
simple mind. Shall I tell you what I am? Shall I say
it? Shall I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But the man&#8217;s hand went up and held her silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to say nothing, Jess,&#8221; he said in his
mildest tone. &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to, sure. Whatever you
are, you&#8217;re all the world to me&ndash;&ndash;jest all.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a sudden cry the woman&#8217;s head dropped upon her
outspread arms, and the merciful tears, so long denied her,
gushed forth. Her body heaved, and it seemed to the distraught
man that her poor heart must be breaking. He did
not know what those tears meant to her. He did not know
that the victory of his love was very, very near. Only he
saw her bowed in passionate distress, and he had no thought
of how to comfort her.</p>
<p>He waited, waited. But the flood once broken loose must
needs spend itself. Such is the way with women, of whom
he had so small an understanding. He turned away to the
window. He stared with unseeing eyes at the fair picture
of the beautiful valley. The moments passed&ndash;&ndash;long, dreary
moments rapidly changing to minutes. And then at last the
storm began to die down, and he turned again towards her
and drew a step nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jess&ndash;&ndash;Jess,&#8221; he murmured.</p>
<p>Then he took another hesitating step.</p>
<p>But his words seemed to have started her tears afresh, and
into his eyes came that painful perplexity again.</p>
<p>Again he ventured, and his step this time brought him
close to her side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jess, gal&ndash;&ndash;Jess,&#8221; he pleaded, with infinite tenderness.</p>
<p>And as the woman continued to sob he stole one arm gently
about her waist. She made no move. Only her shaking
body calmed, and her tears became more silent.</p>
<p>He strove to draw her towards him, but she clung to the
bed-rail with almost child-like persistence, as though she
dared not permit herself the hope his encircling arms inspired.
But she had not rebuffed him, so with some assertion
he thrust his other arm about her, and, exerting force,
deliberately turned her towards him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, don&#8217;t you to cry, lass,&#8221; he whispered softly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you, now. It jest makes me sore right through. It
jest makes me feel all of a choke, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I want to cry, too.
Say, gal, I love you good. I do, Jess&ndash;&ndash;I sure do. Ther&#8217;
ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; in the world I wouldn&#8217;t do to stop them tears.
Come to home, gal&ndash;&ndash;come to home.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as he finished speaking he drew her dark head down
to his breast, and laid his thin cheek against her wealth of
hair. And, pressing her to the home that was for all time
hers, his own eyes filled with tears which slowly rolled down
his cheeks and mingled themselves with hers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<h3>THE REASON WHY</h3>
</div>
<p>When Scipio turned his back upon the valley it was with
the intention of resting his old mule at the place of the
friendly farmer whom he had encountered on his first memorable
visit to James&#8217; secret abode. From thence, after a
night&#8217;s rest, he would start late next day, and make the creek
soon after sundown. For the sake of Jessie he had no desire
to make a daylight entry into the camp.</p>
<p>The old mule certainly needed rest. And, besides, it was
pleasant to prolong the journey. Moments such as the present
were scarce enough in life. And though Jessie was with
him for all time now, he greedily hugged to himself these
hours alone with her, when there was nothing but the fair
blue sky and waving grass, the hills and valleys, to witness
his happiness, none of the harshness of life to obtrude upon
his perfect joy; nothing, not even the merest duties of daily
life, to mar the delicious companionship which his wife&#8217;s
long-desired presence afforded him. The whole journey was
to be a sort of honeymoon, a thousand times sweeter for the
misery and unhappiness through which they had both passed.</p>
<p>He thought of nothing else. The very existence of James
and his gang had passed from his recollection. He had no
mind for dangers of any sort. He had no mind for anything
or anybody but his Jessie, his beautiful Jessie&ndash;&ndash;his wife.</p>
<p>Had he had the least curiosity or interest in other matters,
there were many things, strange things, about the recovery
of his wife which might have set him wondering. For instance,
he might have speculated as to the desertion of the
ranch&ndash;&ndash;the absence of dogs, the absence of all those signs
which tell of a busy enterprise&ndash;&ndash;things which could not be
adequately accounted for by the mere absence of the head of
it, even though he were accompanied by his fighting men.
He might have glanced about among the barns and corrals,
or&ndash;&ndash;he might even have questioned his Jessie.</p>
<p>Had he done either of these things a certain amount of
enlightenment would undoubtedly have penetrated to his
unsuspicious mind. He must inevitably have detected the
hand or hands of his earthly guardian angels in the manner
in which his path had been cleared of all obstructions.</p>
<p>Had he been less occupied with his own happiness, with
the joy of having Jessie once more beside him, and chanced
to look back into the valley as he left it forever, he would
certainly have received enlightenment. But he never knew
what had been done for him, he never knew the subtle
working for his welfare.</p>
<p>Thus it was, all unobserved by him, the moment he was
at sufficient distance from the ranch, three horsemen suddenly
appeared from amidst the most adjacent point of the
forest on the far side of the valley and galloped across to the
house. They ran their horses to cover amongst the buildings
and dismounted, immediately vanishing into one of the barns.</p>
<p>And as they disappeared a good deal of laughter, a good
deal of forceful talk, came from the place which had swallowed
them up. Then, after awhile, the three reappeared
in the open, and with them came an old choreman, whose
joints ached, and whose villainous temper had seriously suffered
under the harsh bonds which had held him secure from
interference with Scipio for so long.</p>
<p>The men herded him out before them, quite heedless of
his bitter vituperation and blasphemy. And when they had
driven him forth Sunny Oak pointed out to him the retreating
buckboard as it vanished over the far hillside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217; they go, you miser&#8217;ble old son of a moose,&#8221; he
cried with a laugh. &#8220;Ther&#8217; they go. An&#8217; I guess when
James gits around ag&#8217;in you&#8217;ll likely pay a mighty fine
reck&#8217;nin&#8217;. An&#8217; I&#8217;ll sure say I won&#8217;t be a heap sorry neither.
You&#8217;ve give me a power o&#8217; trouble comin&#8217; along out here.
I ain&#8217;t had no sort o&#8217; rest fer hours an&#8217; hours, an&#8217; I hate folks
that sets me busy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a pizenous varmint, sure,&#8221; added Sandy, feeling
that Sunny must not be allowed all the talk. &#8220;An&#8217; your
langwidge is that bad I&#8217;ll need to git around a Bible-class
ag&#8217;in to disinfect my ears.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You sure will,&#8221; agreed Toby, with one of his fatuous
grins. &#8220;I never see any feller who needed disinfectin&#8217;
more.&#8221; Then he turned upon the evil-faced choreman and
added his morsel of admonition. &#8220;Say, old man, as you
hope to git buried yourself when James gits around ag&#8217;in, I
guess you best go an&#8217; dig that miser&#8217;ble cur o&#8217; yours under,
&#8217;fore he gits pollutin&#8217; the air o&#8217; this yer valley, same as you
are at the moment. He&#8217;s cost me a goodish scrap, but I
don&#8217;t grudge it him noways. Scrappin&#8217;s an elegant pastime,
sure&ndash;&ndash;when you come out right end of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>After that, cowed but furious, the old man was allowed to
depart, and the three guardians of Scipio&#8217;s person deliberately
returned to their charge. Their instructions were
quite clear, even though they only partially understood the
conditions making their work necessary. Scipio must be
safeguarded. They were to form an invisible escort, clearing
his road for him and making his journey safe. So they
swung into the saddle and rode hot-foot on the trail of their
unconscious charge.</p>
<p>For the most part they rode silently. Already the journey
had been long and tiresomely uneventful, and Sunny Oak
particularly reveled in an impotent peevishness which held
him intensely sulky. The widower, too, was feeling anything
but amiable. What with his recent futile work on a
claim which was the ridicule of the camp, and now the discomfort
of a dreary journey, his feelings towards Wild Bill
were none too cordial. Perhaps Toby was the most cheerful
of the three. The matters of the Trust had been a pleasant
break in the daily routine of dispossessing himself of remittances
from his friends in the East. And the unusual
effort made him feel good.</p>
<p>They had reached the crown of the hill bordering the
valley, where the trail debouched upon the prairie beyond,
and the effort of easing his horse, as the struggling beast
clawed its way up the shelving slope, at last set loose the
tide of the loafer&#8217;s ill-temper. He suddenly turned upon his
companions, his angry face dirty and sweating.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;of all the blamed fules I&#8217;d say we three
was the craziest ever pupped.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy turned inquiring, contemptuous eyes in his direction.
He always adopted a defensive attitude when Sunny
opened out. Toby only grinned and waited for what was
to come.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217;?&#8221; inquired Sandy in his coldest manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217;? Gee! it don&#8217;t need a mule&#8217;s intellec&#8217; to get
my meanin&#8217;,&#8221; said the loafer witheringly. &#8220;Wot, in the
name o&#8217; glory, would I mean but this doggone ride we&#8217;re
takin&#8217;? Say, here&#8217;s us three muttons chasin&#8217; glory on the
tail o&#8217; two soppy lambs that ain&#8217;t got savvee enough between
&#8217;em to guess the north end of a hoss when he&#8217;s goin&#8217; south.
An&#8217;, wot&#8217;s more, we&#8217;re doin&#8217; it like a lot o&#8217; cluckin&#8217; hens
chasin&#8217; a brood o&#8217; fule chicks. I tell you it jest makes me
sick. An&#8217; ef I don&#8217;t git six weeks&#8217; rest straight on end after
this is thro&#8217; I&#8217;ll be gettin&#8217; plumb &#8216;bug,&#8217; or&ndash;&ndash;or the colic, or
suthin&#8217; ornery bum. I&#8217;ve done. Sufferin&#8217; Creek ain&#8217;t no
place fer a peace-lovin&#8217; feller like me, whose doin&#8217; all he
knows to git thro&#8217; life easy an&#8217; without breakin&#8217; up a natterally
delicate constitootion. I&#8217;m done. I quit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy&#8217;s face was a study in sneers. Not because he did
not agree with the sentiments, but Sunny always irritated
him. But Toby only grinned the harder, and for once, while
the widower was preparing an adequate retort, contrived to
forestall him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me, Sunny, you ain&#8217;t got a heap o&#8217; kick comin&#8217;
to you,&#8221; he said in his slow way. &#8220;I allow you come in
this racket because you notioned it. Mebbe you&#8217;ll say why
you did it, else?&#8221;</p>
<p>This unexpected challenge from Toby had the effect of
diverting the widower&#8217;s thoughts. He left the consideration
of the snub he had been preparing for the loafer for some
future time, and waited for the other&#8217;s reply. But Sunny
was roused, and stared angrily round upon the grinning face
of his questioner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess that ain&#8217;t no affair of yours, anyway,&#8221; he snorted.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t stand fer questions from no remittance guy. Gee!
things is gittin&#8217; pretty low-down when it comes to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe a remittance man ain&#8217;t a first-class callin&#8217;,&#8221; said
Toby, his grin replaced by a hot flush. &#8220;But if it comes to
that I&#8217;d say a lazy loafin&#8217; bum ain&#8217;t a heap o&#8217; credit noways
neither. Howsum, them things don&#8217;t alter matters any.
An&#8217; I, fer one, is sick o&#8217; your grouse&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;cos that&#8217;s all it is.
Say, you&#8217;re settin&#8217; ther&#8217; on top o&#8217; that hoss like a badly sculptured
image that needs a week&#8217;s bathin&#8217;, an&#8217; talkin&#8217; like the
no-account fule most fellers guess you to be. Wal, show us
you ain&#8217;t none o&#8217; them things, show us you got some sort of
a man inside your hide, an&#8217; tell us straight why you&#8217;re out on
this doggone trail when you&#8217;re yearnin&#8217; fer your blankets.&#8221;</p>
<p>The attack was so unexpected that for once Sunny had no
reply ready. And Sandy positively beamed upon the challenger.
And so they rode on for a few moments. Then
Toby broke the silence impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal?&#8221; he inquired, his face wreathed in a grin that had
none of the amiability usual to it.</p>
<p>Sunny turned; and it was evident all his good-nature was
restored. He had suddenly realized that to be baited by the
fatuous Toby was almost refreshing, and he spoke without
any sort of animosity. It would certainly have been different
had the challenge come from the hectoring widower.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why for do I do it&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; hate it? Say, that&#8217;s jest one o&#8217;
them things a feller can&#8217;t tell. Y&#8217;see, a feller grouses thro&#8217;
life, a-worritin&#8217; hisself &#8217;cos things don&#8217;t seem right by his
way o&#8217; thinkin&#8217;. That&#8217;s natteral. He guesses he wants to
do things one way, then sudden-like, fer no reason he ken
see, he gits doin&#8217; &#8217;em another. That&#8217;s natteral, too. Y&#8217;see,
ther&#8217;s two things, it seems to me, makes a feller act. One&#8217;s
his fool head, an&#8217; the other&ndash;&ndash;well, I don&#8217;t rightly know what
the other is, &#8217;cep&#8217; it&#8217;s his stummick. Anyways, that&#8217;s how it
is. My head makes me want to go one way, an&#8217; my feet gits
me goin&#8217; another. So it is with this lay-out. An&#8217; I guess,
ef you was sure to git to rock-bottom o&#8217; things, I&#8217;d say we&#8217;re
all doin&#8217; this thing &#8217;cos Wild Bill said so.&#8221;</p>
<p>He finished up with a chuckle that thoroughly upset the
equilibrium of the widower, and set him jumping at the
chance of retort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;re scairt to death o&#8217; Wild Bill,&#8221; he sneered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; drawled Sunny easily, &#8220;I guess he&#8217;s a feller wuth
bein&#8217; scairt of&ndash;&ndash;which is more than you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandy snorted defiantly. But a further wordy war was
averted by the remittance man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217;s more of a man to you than I allowed, Sunny,&#8221; he
said sincerely. &#8220;There sure is. Bill&#8217;s a man, whatever else
he is. He&#8217;s sure the best man I&#8217;ve seen on Sufferin&#8217; Creek.
But you&#8217;re wrong &#8217;bout him bein&#8217; the reason of us worritin&#8217;
ourselves sick on this yer trail. It ain&#8217;t your head which
needs re-decoratin&#8217;, neither. Nor it ain&#8217;t your stummick,
which, I allow, ain&#8217;t the most wholesome part of you.
Neither it ain&#8217;t your splay feet. You missed it, Sunny, an&#8217;
I allus tho&#8217;t you was a right smart guy. The reason you&#8217;re
on this doggone trail chasin&#8217; glory wot don&#8217;t never git
around, is worryin&#8217; along in a buckboard ahead of us, behind
ole Minky&#8217;s mule, an&#8217; he&#8217;s hoofin&#8217; to home at an express
slug&#8217;s gait. That&#8217;s the reason you&#8217;re on the trail, an&#8217; nothin&#8217;
else. You&#8217;re jest a lazy, loafin&#8217;, dirty bum as &#8217;ud make mud
out of a fifty-gallon bath o&#8217; boilin&#8217; soapsuds if you was set
in it, but you was mighty sore seein&#8217; pore Zip kicked to death
by his rotten luck. An&#8217; feelin&#8217; that always you kind o&#8217; fergot
to be tired. That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re on this doggone trail. &#8217;Cos
your fool heart ain&#8217;t as dirty as your carkis.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as he fired his last word Toby dashed his spurs into
the flanks of his jaded horse, and galloped out of reach of the
tide of vituperation he knew full well to be flowing in his
wake.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<h3>THE LUCK OF SCIPIO</h3>
</div>
<p>Suffering Creek was again in a state of ferment. It
seemed as if there were nothing but one excitement after
another in the place now. No sooner was the matter of the
gold-stage passed than a fresh disturbance was upon them.
And again the established industry of the place was completely
at a standstill. Human nature could no more withstand
the infection that was ravaging the camp than keep
cool under a political argument. The thing that had happened
now was tremendous.</p>
<p>Staid miners, old experienced hands whose lives were
wedded to their quest of gold, whose interest in affairs was
only taken from a standpoint of their benefit, or otherwise,
to the gold interest, were caught in the feverish tide, and
sent hurtling along with the rushing flood. Men whose
pulses usually only received a quickening from the news of a
fresh gold discovery now found themselves gaping with the
wonder of it all, and asking themselves how it was this thing
had happened, and if, indeed, it had happened, or were they
dreaming.</p>
<p>The whole thing was monstrous, stupendous, and here,
happening in their midst, practically all Suffering Creek were
out of it. But in spite of this the fever of excitement raged,
and no one was wholly impervious to it. Opinions ran riot&ndash;&ndash;opinions
hastily conceived and expressed without consideration,
which is the way of people whose nerves have been
suddenly strung tight by a matter of absorbing interest.
Men who knew nothing of the nature of things which could
produce so astonishing a result found themselves dissecting
causes and possibilities which did not exist, and never could
exist. They hastily proceeded to lay down their own law
upon the subject with hot emphasis. They felt it necessary
to do this to disguise their lack of knowledge and restore
their personal standing. For the latter, they felt, had been
sorely shaken by this sudden triumph of those whom they
had so lately ridiculed.</p>
<p>And what was this wonderful thing that had happened?
What was it that had set these hardened men crazy with
excitement? It had come so suddenly, so mysteriously. It
had come during the hours of darkness, when weary men
hugged their blankets, and dreamed their dreams of the craft
which made up their whole world.</p>
<p>There was no noise, no epoch-making upheaval, no blatant
trumpetings to herald its coming. And the discovery was
made by a single man on his way to his work just after the
great golden sun had risen.</p>
<p>He was trailing his way along the creek bank over the road
which led eventually to Spawn City. He was slouching
along the wood-lined track at that swinging, laborious gait
of a heavy-booted man. And his way lay across the oozy
claim of Scipio.</p>
<p>But he never reached the claim. Long before he came in
view of it he found himself confronted with a sluggish
stream progressing slowly along the beaten sand of the trail.
For a moment he believed that the creek had, for some
freakish reason, suddenly overflowed its banks. But this
thought was swiftly swept aside, and he stood snuffing the
air like some warhorse, and gaping at the stream as it
lapped about his feet.</p>
<p>It came on slowly but irresistibly. And ahead of him, and
amongst the trailside bush, he beheld nothing but this rising
flood. Then of a sudden something of its meaning penetrated
his dazed comprehension, and, turning abruptly, he
started to run for the higher ground. He sped swiftly
through the surrounding bush, dodging tree-trunks, and
threading his way circuitously in the direction where stood
the great cut bank of quartz which backed Scipio&#8217;s claim.
The smell of the air had told him its tale, and he knew that
he had made a wonderful, an astounding discovery. And
with this knowledge had come the thought of his own possible
advantage. Eagerly he began to seek the source of the
flood.</p>
<p>But his hopes were completely dashed the moment he
reached the bank overlooking Scipio&#8217;s claim. There lay the
source of the flood, right in the heart of the little man&#8217;s
despised land. A great gusher of coal-oil was belching from
the mouth of the shaft which Sandy Joyce had been at work
upon, and the whole clearing, right from the oozy swamp
beyond to the higher ground of the river bank, stealing its
way along trail and through bush, lay a vast shallow lake of
raw coal-oil.</p>
<p>The disappointed man waited just sufficiently long to
realize the magnitude of Scipio&#8217;s luck, and then set off at a
run for the camp.</p>
<p>And in half-an-hour the camp was in a raging fever. In
half-an-hour nearly the whole of Suffering Creek had set out
for the claim, that they might see for themselves this wonderful
thing that had happened. In half-an-hour the whole
thing was being explained in theory by everybody to everybody
else. In half-an-hour everybody was inquiring for
Scipio, and each and all were desirous of being first to convey
the news.</p>
<p>And when it was discovered that Scipio was from home,
and knew nothing of his good fortune, a fresh thought came
to every mind. What had become of him? They learned
that he had borrowed Minky&#8217;s buckboard, and had driven
away. And immediately in the public mind crept an unexpressed
question. Had Zip abandoned the place in the
face of his ill-luck, and, if so, what about this gigantic oil
find?</p>
<p>However, there was nothing to be done at present but wait.
The flow of oil could not be checked, and the tremendous
waste must go on. The gusher would flow on until the
pressure below lessened, and after that it would die down,
and require pumps to further exhaust it.</p>
<p>So the camp resigned itself to a contemplation of this
wonderful new industry that had sprung up unsought in their
midst; and the luck of Scipio was upon everybody&#8217;s lips.
Nor was there only the wonder of it in every mind, for, after
the first feelings of envy and covetousness had passed away,
the humor of the thing became apparent. And it was Joe
Brand, in the course of discussing the matter with Minky,
who first drew attention to the queer pranks which fortune
sometimes plays.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, don&#8217;t it lick creation?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Can you beat
it? No, sirree. It&#8217;s the best ever&ndash;&ndash;it sure is. Say, here&#8217;s
the worstest mule-head ever got foothold on this yer continent
sets out to chase gold in a place no one outside a bug-house
would ever find time to git busy, an&#8217; may I be skinned
alive an&#8217; my bones grilled fer a cannibal&#8217;s supper if he don&#8217;t
find sech a fortune in ile as &#8217;ud set all the whole blamed
world&#8217;s ile market hatin&#8217; itself. Gee!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Minky nodded his head. He also smiled slyly upon
those who stood about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217; sure is elegant humor to most things in this
yer life,&#8221; he said dryly. &#8220;Which &#8217;minds me Wild Bill
bo&#8217;t ha&#8217;f o&#8217; that claim o&#8217; Zip&#8217;s &#8217;fore he set out fer Spawn
City.&#8221;</p>
<p>And at his words somehow a curious thoughtfulness fell
upon his hearers. Nor was there any responsive smile
among them. The humor he spoke of seemed to have passed
them by, leaving them quite untouched by its point. And
presently they drifted away, joining other groups, where the
reminder that Bill had been derided by the whole camp for
his absurd purchase had an equally damping effect.</p>
<p>But the day was to be more eventful even than the promise
of the morning had suggested. And the second surprise
came about noon.</p>
<p>Excitement was still raging. Half the camp was down at
Zip&#8217;s claim watching the miracle of the oil gusher, and the
other half was either on their way thither or returning from
it. Some of them were gathering the raw oil in cans and
tubs, others were hurrying to do so. And none of them
quite knew why they were doing it, or what, if any, the use
they could put the stuff to. They were probably inspired by
the fact that there was the stuff going to waste by the hundreds
of gallons, and they felt it incumbent upon them to
save what they could. Anyway, it was difficult to tear themselves
away from the fascinations of Nature&#8217;s prodigal outburst,
and so, as being the easiest and most pleasurable
course, they abandoned themselves to it.</p>
<p>So it was that Minky found his store deserted. He
lounged idly out on to the veranda and propped himself
against one of the posts. And, standing there, his thoughtful
eyes roamed, subtly attracted to the spot where Zip&#8217;s luck
had demonstrated itself.</p>
<p>He stood there for some time watching the hurrying figures
of the miners as they moved to and fro, but his mind
was far away. Somehow Zip&#8217;s luck, in spite of the excessive
figures which extravagant minds had estimated it at, only
took second place with him. He was thinking of the man
who had journeyed to Spawn City. He was worrying about
him, his one and only friend.</p>
<p>He had understood something of that self-imposed task
which the gambler had undertaken, though its full significance
had never quite been his. Now he felt that in some
way he was responsible. Now he felt that the journey
should never have been taken. He felt that he should have
refused to ship his gold. And yet he knew full well that his
refusal would have been quite useless. Wild Bill was a man
whom opposition only drove the harder, and he would have
contrived a means of carrying out his purpose, no matter
what barred his way.</p>
<p>However, even with this assurance he still felt uncomfortably
regretful. His responsibility was no less, and for the
life of him he could not rise to enthusiasm over this luck of
Scipio&#8217;s. It would have been different if Bill had been there
to discuss the matter with him.</p>
<p>And as the moments passed his spirits fell lower and
lower, until at last a great depression weighed him down.</p>
<p>It was in the midst of this depression, when, for the hundredth
time, he had wished that his friend had never started
out on his wild enterprise, that he suddenly found himself
staring out across the river at the Spawn City trail. He
stared for some moments, scarcely comprehending that at
which he looked. Then suddenly he became aware of a
horseman racing down the slope towards the river, and
in a moment mind and body were alert, and he stood
waiting.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Minky was still standing on his veranda. But he was no
longer leaning against the post; he was holding a letter in his
hand which he had just finished reading. It was a painful-looking
document for all its neat, clear writing. It was
stained with patches of dark red that were almost brown,
and the envelope he held in his other hand was almost
unrecognizable for the same hideous stain that completely
covered it.</p>
<p>The man who had delivered it was resting on the edge of
the veranda. He had told his story; and now he sat chewing,
and watching his weary horse tethered at the hitching-post
a few yards away.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; he drove that cart fer six hours&ndash;&ndash;dead?&#8221; Minky
asked, without removing his eyes from the blood-stained
letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s sure how I sed,&#8221; returned the messenger, and
went stolidly on with his chewing. The other breathed
deeply.</p>
<p>Then he read the letter over again. He read it slowly, so
as to miss no word or meaning it might contain. And,
curiously, as he read a feeling of wonder filled him at the
excellence of the writing and composition. He did not seem
to remember having seen Bill&#8217;s writing before. And here
the rough, hard-living gambler was displaying himself a man
of considerable education. It was curious. All the years
of their friendship had passed without him discovering that
his gambling friend was anything but an illiterate ruffian of
the West, with nothing but a great courage, a powerful
personality and a moderately honest heart to recommend
him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>My Dear Minky,</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m dead&ndash;&ndash;dead as mutton. Whether I&#8217;m cooked
mutton, or raw, I can&#8217;t just say. Anyway, I&#8217;m dead&ndash;&ndash;or
you wouldn&#8217;t get this letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now this letter is not to express regrets, or to sentimentalize.
You&#8217;ll agree that&#8217;s not my way. Death doesn&#8217;t
worry me any. No, this letter is just a &#8216;last will and testament,&#8217;
as the lawyers have it. And I&#8217;m sending it to you because
I know you&#8217;ll see things fixed right for me. You see,
I put everything into your hands for two reasons: you&#8217;re
honest, and you&#8217;re my friend. Now, seeing you&#8217;re rich and
prosperous I leave you nothing out of my wad. But I&#8217;d like
to hand you a present of my team&ndash;&ndash;if they&#8217;re still alive&ndash;&ndash;team
and harness and cart. And you&#8217;ll know, seeing I always
had a notion the sun, moon and stars rose and set in my
horses, the spirit in which I give them to you, and the regard
I had for our friendship. Be good to them, old friend.</p>
<p>For the rest, my dollars, and anything else I&#8217;ve got, I&#8217;d
like Zip&#8217;s kids to have. They&#8217;re bright kids, and I&#8217;ve got
a notion for them. And, seeing Zip&#8217;s their father, maybe
dollars will be useful to them. You can divide things
equally between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;And in conclusion you can tell Zip if he can do a good
turn, which I don&#8217;t suppose he&#8217;ll be able to, to either Sunny
Oak, or Sandy Joyce, or Toby Jenks, he&#8217;d best do it.
Because he owes them something he&#8217;ll probably never hear
about.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the last will and testament, as the lawyers say, of</p>
<p class='ralign'>&#8220;Your old friend,<span class='rindent6'>&nbsp;</span><br />
&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Wild Bill.</span><span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span><br />
&#8220;(A no-account gambler, late of Abilene.)&#8221;<span class='rindent4'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Minky looked up from the letter again, and his eyes were
shadowed. He felt that that letter contained more of the
gambler&#8217;s heart than he would ever have allowed himself to
display in life.</p>
<p>And into his mind came many memories&ndash;&ndash;memories that
stirred him deeply. He was thinking of the days when he
had first encountered Bill years ago, when the name of Wild
Bill was a terror throughout Texas and the neighboring
States. And he smiled as he remembered how a perturbed
Government had been forced, for their own peace of mind,
and for the sake of the peace of the country, to put this
&#8220;terror&#8221; on the side of law and order, and make him a
sheriff of the county. And then, too, he remembered the
trouble Bill was always getting into through mixing up his
private feuds with his public duties. Still, he was a great
sheriff, and never was such order kept in the county.</p>
<p>He turned again to the man at his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; he got thro&#8217; with the gold?&#8221; he inquired slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest as I sed,&#8221; retorted the weary messenger. &#8220;Guess I
helped sheriff to deposit it in the bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man stirred impatiently and spat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead&ndash;&ndash;as mutton.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minky sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you come along the Spawn City trail?&#8221; he asked
presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t got wings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you saw&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The birds flappin&#8217; around&ndash;&ndash;nigh chokin&#8217; with human
meat.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man laughed cynically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you recognize&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see James. He was dead&ndash;&ndash;as mutton, too&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; all
his gang. Gee! It must &#8217;a&#8217; bin a hell of a scrap.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man spat out a stream of tobacco juice and rubbed
his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sure must,&#8221; agreed Minky. And he passed into the
store.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It was dark when Scipio urged the old mule up the bank
at the fork of the creek. He was very weary, and Jessie
was asleep beside him, with her head pillowed upon his
shoulder. His arm was about her, supporting her, and he
sat rigid, lest the bumping of the rattling vehicle should
waken her. The position for him was trying, but he never
wavered. Cramped and weary as he was, he strove by every
means in his power to leave her undisturbed.</p>
<p>And as he passed the river three ghostly figures ambled
down to the bank, and, after drinking their horses, likewise
passed over. But while Scipio kept to the trail, they vanished
amidst the woods. Their task was over, and they
sought the shortest route to their homes.</p>
<p>And so Scipio came to his claim. And such was his state
of mind, so was he taken up with the happiness which the
presence of his wife beside him gave him, and such was his
delight in looking forward to the days to come, that he saw
nothing of that which lay about him.</p>
<p>The air to him was sweet with all the perfumes his thankful
heart inspired in his thoughts. His road was a path of
roses. The reek of oil was beyond his simple ken. Nor did
he heed the slush, slush of his mule&#8217;s feet, as the old beast
floundered through the lake of oil spread out on all sides
about him. The gurgling, the sadly bubbling gusher, even,
might have been one of the fairy sounds of night, for all
thought he gave to it.</p>
<p>No; blind to all things practical as he always was, how was
it possible that Scipio, leaving Suffering Creek a poor, struggling
prospector, should realize by these outward signs that
he had returned to it, possibly, a millionaire?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<h3>HOME</h3>
</div>
<p>Scipio stood in the doorway of his hut with a hopelessly
dazed look in his pale eyes and a perplexed frown upon his
brow. He had just returned from Minky&#8217;s store, whither
he had been to fetch his twins home. He had brought them
with him, leading them, one in each hand. And at sight of
their mother they had torn themselves free from their
father&#8217;s detaining hands and rushed at her.</p>
<p>Jessie, strangely subdued, but with a wonderful light of
happiness in her eyes, was in the midst of &#8220;turning out&#8221; the
bedroom. She had spent the whole morning cleaning and
garnishing with a vigor, with a heartwhole enjoyment, such
as never in all her married life had she displayed before.
And now, as the children rushed at her, their piping voices
shrieking their joyous greeting, she hugged them to her
bosom as though she would squeeze their precious lives out
of them. She laughed and cried at the same time in a way
that only women in the throes of unspeakable joy can. Her
words, too, were incoherent, as incoherent as the babble of
the children themselves. It was a sight of mother-love
rarely to be witnessed, a sight which, under normal conditions,
must have filled the simple heart of Scipio with a joy
and happiness quite beyond words.</p>
<p>But just now it left him untouched, and as he silently
looked on he passed one hand helplessly across his forehead.
He pushed his hat back so that his stubby fingers could rake
amongst his yellow hair. And Jessie, suddenly looking up
from the two heads nestling so close against her bosom,
realized the trouble in her husband&#8217;s face. Her realization
came with a swiftness that would have been impossible in
those old days of discontent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Zip,&#8221; she cried, starting to her feet and coming
quickly towards him, &#8220;what&ndash;&ndash;what&#8217;s the matter? What&#8217;s
wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>But the little man only shook his head dazedly, and his
eyes wandered from her face to the two silently staring children,
and then to the table so carefully laid for the midday
meal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, sit down,&#8221; Jessie hurried on, darting towards a
chair and setting it for him beside the stove. &#8220;You&#8217;re sick,
sure,&#8221; she declared, peering into his pale face, as he silently,
almost helplessly, obeyed her. &#8220;It&#8217;s the sun,&#8221; she went on.
&#8220;That&#8217;s what it is&ndash;&ndash;driving in the sun all yesterday. It&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s
been too much for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the man passed a hand across his brow. But this
time he shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t the sun, Jess,&#8221; he said vaguely. &#8220;It&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s
oil!&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment the woman stared. Then she turned to the
gaping twins, and hustled them out of the room to play.
Poor Zip&#8217;s head had suddenly gone wrong, she believed,
and&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>But as she came back from the door she found that he had
risen from the chair in which she had set him, and was standing
looking at her, and through her, and beyond her, as
though she were not there at all. And in an instant she was
at his side, with an arm thrown protectingly about his
shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, Zip&ndash;&ndash;oh, tell me, dear, what&#8217;s wrong? Surely&ndash;&ndash;surely,
after all that has gone&ndash;&ndash;Oh, tell me! Don&#8217;t
keep me in suspense. Is&ndash;&ndash;is it James?&#8221; she finished up in
a terrified whisper.</p>
<p>The mention of that detested name had instant effect.
Scipio&#8217;s face cleared, and the dazed look of his eyes vanished
as if by magic. He shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;James is dead,&#8221; he said simply. And Jessie breathed a
sigh of such relief that even he observed it, and it gladdened
him. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;James is sure dead. Wild Bill
done him up and his whole gang. But Bill&#8217;s gone, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill, too?&#8221; Jessie murmured.</p>
<p>Scipio nodded; and perplexity stole over his face again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t seem to understand. Y&#8217;see, he done
James up, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; James done him up&ndash;&ndash;sort o&#8217; mutual.
Y&#8217;see, they told me the rights of it, but&ndash;&ndash;but ther&#8217;s so many
things I&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t seem to got room for them all in my
head. It seems, too, that Bill had quite a piece of money.
An&#8217; he&#8217;s kind of given it to the kids. I&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221; demanded the practical feminine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seventy thousand dollars,&#8221; replied the bewildered man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seventy thou&ndash;&ndash;Who told you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&ndash;&ndash;Minky. Said he&#8217;d got it all. But&ndash;&ndash;but that
ain&#8217;t the worst.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Worst?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessie was smiling now&ndash;&ndash;smiling with that motherly, protecting
confidence so wonderfully womanly.</p>
<p>Scipio nodded; and his eyes sought hers for encouragement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ther&#8217;s the oil, millions an&#8217; millions of it&ndash;&ndash;gallons, I
mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oil? Millions of gallons? Oh, Zip, do&ndash;&ndash;do be sensible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessie stood before him, and his worried look seemed to
have found a reflection upon her handsome face.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t me. It ain&#8217;t my fault. It sure ain&#8217;t, Jess,&#8221; he
declared wistfully. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen it. It&#8217;s there. My pore
claim&#8217;s jest drowned with it. I&#8217;ll never find that gold now&ndash;&ndash;not
if I was to pump a year. It&#8217;s just bubbling up an&#8217; up
out o&#8217; the bowels of the earth, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; Minky says I&#8217;ll have
to set up pumps an&#8217; things, an&#8217; he&#8217;s goin&#8217; to help me. So is
Sunny Oak, an&#8217; Toby, an&#8217; Sandy, an&#8217; he sez we&#8217;ll find the
gold sure if we pump the oil. Sez it&#8217;s there, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll be rich
as Rockefeller an&#8217; all them millionaires. But I can&#8217;t seem to
see it, if the gold&#8217;s drownded in that messy, smelly oil.
Maybe you ken see. You&#8217;re quicker&#8217;n me. You&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jessie never let him finish.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oil?&#8221; she cried, her eyes swimming with tears of joy
and gentle affection for the simple soul so incapable of grasping
anything but his own single purpose. &#8220;Oil?&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;Oh, Zip, don&#8217;t you understand? Don&#8217;t you see? It&#8217;s oil&ndash;&ndash;coal-oil.
You&#8217;ve been searching for gold and found oil.
And there&#8217;s millions of dollars in coal-oil.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the little man&#8217;s face dropped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems a pity,&#8221; he said dispiritedly. &#8220;I could &#8217;a&#8217; swore
ther&#8217; was gold there&ndash;&ndash;I sure could. I&#8217;d have found it, too&ndash;&ndash;if
the oil hadn&#8217;t washed us out. Bill thought so, too; an&#8217;
Bill was right smart. Guess we&#8217;ll find it, though, after we
pumped the oil.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly the woman reached out both arms and laid her
hands upon his diminutive shoulders. Her eyes had grown
very tender.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zip,&#8221; she cried gently, &#8220;Zip, I think God has been very
good to me. He&#8217;s been kinder to me than He has been to
you. You deserve His goodness; I don&#8217;t. And yet He&#8217;s
given me a man with a heart of&ndash;&ndash;of gold. He&#8217;s given me
a man whose love I have trampled under-foot and flung
away. He&#8217;s given me a man who, by his own simple honesty,
his goodness, has shown me the road to perfect happiness.
He&#8217;s given me all this in return for a sin that can
never be wiped out&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But suddenly Scipio freed himself from the gentle grasp
of her restraining hands, and caught her in his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t you to say it, Jess,&#8221; he cried, all his
great love shining in his eyes. His perplexity and regret
were all gone now, and only had he thought of his love.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you to say nuthin&#8217; against yourself. You&#8217;re my wife&ndash;&ndash;my
Jessie. An&#8217; as long as I&#8217;ve got life I don&#8217;t want
nothin&#8217; else&ndash;&ndash;but my Jessie. Say, gal, I do love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;oh, if you can only believe me, Zip, I love
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man reached up and drew the woman&#8217;s face down to
his, and kissed her on the lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t matter &#8217;bout not finding that gold now,&#8221; he
cried, and kissed her again.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, momma, ain&#8217;t it dinner yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ess, me want din-din.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man and woman sprang guiltily apart before the
wondering eyes of their children, and the next moment both
of the small creatures were caught up and hugged in loving
arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, sure, kiddies,&#8221; cried Scipio, his face wreathed in
happy smiles. &#8220;Momma&#8217;s got dinner all fixed&ndash;&ndash;so come
right along.&#8221;</p>
